            "content_html": "<p>Age may be just a number, but that number matters when it comes to retiring.</p><p>The common definition of early retirement is any age before 65 — that’s when you may qualify for <a href=\"https://www.medicare.gov/\"><strong>Medicare</strong></a> benefits. Currently, men retire at an <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/retirement/when-should-i-retire-pros-and-cons-different-ages/#:~:text=The%20average%20retirement%20age%20for,and%20men%20at%2064.6%20years.\" > <strong>average age of 64</strong> </a> , while for women the average retirement age is 62.<sup>1,2</sup></p><p>Retiring before the traditional age of 65 can feel exciting and give you something to look forward to. Whether you want to travel, take up new hobbies, or simply start a new chapter in your life, consider having a retirement plan.</p><p>Even if you’re one of the lucky few who don’t want or plan to retire, understanding what’s possible is valuable as you enter the later stages of life.</p><h2>Early retirement challenges</h2><p>While there is research to show that working longer may keep you healthier and happier, there’s also evidence for the opposing view.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/\"> <strong>National Bureau of Economic Research</strong> </a> found that “retirement improves both health and life satisfaction,” in part by factoring in the number of people who are forced to retire due to health issues.<sup>3</sup></p><p>However, one challenge is ensuring that you have enough assets to provide an acceptable level of income throughout your remaining years, so you’re financially ready to live without a paycheck.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm\"> <strong>average lifespan</strong> </a> in the U.S. is just under 79 years. For someone who retires at 55, this means they need to save up at least 24 years’ worth of income, and even healthier individuals who live beyond the age of 79 may need to have an even larger nest egg.<sup>4</sup></p><h2>How Social Security affects early retirement</h2><p>While you’ll become <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/?gclid=CjwKCAjw8df2BRA3EiwAvfZWaGVnIDD-2sjamkmHoqAPk4mc6ZbHA7Ga3R_mdABTf8Ox4KiX4E1YGhoCEXgQAvD_BwE\" > <strong>eligible for Social Security</strong> </a> at age 62, you won’t qualify for your full monthly benefit amount until a few years later.<sup>5</sup></p><p>If you claim your benefits by 62, you only get roughly 75% of the full amount, which is adjusted because you’ll be getting checks for a longer period of time.</p><p>Spousal benefits can also be decreased if you take your benefit early. Specifically, spousal benefits are reduced to <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/1943.html\"> <strong>35% of your full retirement amount</strong> </a> , compared to 50% if you wait until at least 66.</p><p>If you are healthy and likely to live a long time, you may consider delaying Social Security until age 70 to help you get the most value from the system you’ve paid into over your working years.</p><h2>How Medicare affects early retirement</h2><p>Medicare benefits start on the first day of the month in which you turn 65.</p><p>If you retire before this age, you will need to consider alternative health insurance options. You could explore if your former insurance plan will keep you grouped with the actively employed population as a retiree. (This is a typically rare yet lucrative benefit these days.)</p><p>Other options are COBRA or Health-Share, or joining your spouse’s plan if they are still working.</p><p>Weigh your health insurance options to see which works best for you until your Medicare coverage begins.</p><h2>How your savings affects early retirement</h2><p>If you have sufficient savings, retiring early may be more achievable than you think. Why? Many people assume their retirement money is off limits until they reach age 59½. But a special rule in most 401(k) plans allows penalty-free withdrawals from age 55 – 59½ — but only if you leave your job after your 55th birthday.</p><p>If you still have money in your 401(k) plan from a former employer, and assuming you weren’t at least age 55 when you left that employer, you’ll have to wait until age 59½ to start taking withdrawals without penalty.</p><p>Additionally, if you have old 401(k)s rolled into your current 401(k) before you retire from your current job, you will have access to these funds penalty-free if you leave your current job after your 55<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p><p>As you save for retirement, consider diversifying your savings. Most people focus on filling up their 401(k) bucket, but remember you may want to consider taxable or Roth (when possible) savings. Putting money in different account types (pretax, taxable, post-tax) may help you retire before age 59½. It will also offer flexibility and possible tax savings if you can be strategic about the account types you withdraw from in retirement.</p><h2>Suggested next steps for you</h2><p>Many people can’t wait for the day when they finally call it quits on their careers. Still, constantly worrying about finances isn’t exactly the way to spend your later years.</p><p>You can take actions now to help get yourself on track:</p><ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\"> <li> Project your retirement readiness with our free Retirement Planner.

Is a million dollars enough money to ensure a financially secure future?</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com/retirement/planning/how-long-million-last-retirement-state/\" > <strong>recent analysis</strong> </a> determined that a $1 million retirement nest egg may only last about 20 years depending on what state you live in.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Based on this, if you retire at age 65 and live until you turn 84, $1 million will probably be enough retirement savings for you. However, it’s important to remember there is no one-size-fits-all amount. Rather than shooting for a specific number like $1 million, striving to save as much as you reasonably can is a good goal.</p><h2> Factors to consider: How long will $1 million last in retirement?</h2><p>How much you save for your future depends on several factors and your goals, including the key ones listed below:</p><h3> <strong>1. Your desired retirement lifestyle</strong></h3><p>Do you have a picture in your mind of what retirement will look like for you? For example, do you plan to travel extensively, dine at the best restaurants, spend time with children and grandchildren (and spoil the grandkids), tour the country in a motorhome, buy a yacht or sailboat, or join a country club? If so, you may need a lot of money to support this kind of lifestyle.</p><p>On the other hand, if you envision a simpler and more frugal retirement lifestyle, or you are one of the lucky few who has a robust retirement pension, you might have plenty of money in the bank to retire on and still leave a generous inheritance for your heirs.</p><h3> <strong>2. Your risk tolerance and rate of return</strong></h3><p>When entering retirement, many people adjust their asset allocation to a less risky mix of stocks, bonds and cash alternatives.<sup>2</sup> While reducing volatility, this generally comes with an expectation of lower rates of return throughout retirement.</p><p>Finding the right balance between risk and return could potentially stretch your retirement nest egg significantly further if that money was invested more aggressively throughout retirement. But this could also subject your retirement funds to higher risk of loss, which might jeopardize your retirement financial security.</p><p>Managing the risk-reward tradeoff is something that each individual and couple must seriously consider. It might be smart to discuss this with a financial professional.</p><h3> <strong>3. Your health and life expectancy</strong></h3><p>Healthcare expenses can eat up a big chunk of your retirement nest egg, depending on the type of healthcare coverage you have and what health issues you encounter during your retirement. In fact, according to a <a href=\"https://hvsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-Retirement-Healthcare-Costs-Data-Report.pdf\" > <strong>recent study</strong> , </a> a healthy 65-year-old couple could see their annual healthcare costs go up by nearly 6% per year in retirement because of inflation.<sup>3</sup></p><p>While Medicare will partially cover many healthcare expenses, there will still be copays and other out-of-pocket medical expenses you’re responsible for. If you are in poor health or experience major medical complications after you retire, this could drain your nest egg faster than you may have planned.</p><p>Further, if your family has a history of longevity, you might live longer than average. If you end up outliving the average lifespan, you might need a healthy chunk of change to last throughout retirement. On average, according to the Social Security Administration’s 2019 Period Life Table, a 65-year-old man today <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html\"> can expect to live </a> until 84 while a 65-year-old woman can expect to live until 86.4</p><h3> <strong>4. Where you live in retirement</strong></h3><p>It’s important to evaluate the overall cost of living in any given state, in addition to your state’s tax rates. Some retirees choose to relocate in retirement to reduce their overall expenses.</p><h3> <strong>5. How much income you receive in retirement</strong></h3><p>Your retirement savings probably won’t be your only source of income in retirement. You’ll probably receive Social Security income and you also might choose to work part-time in order to generate additional income. Every dollar of additional income you receive in retirement will help your retirement nest egg last longer and help improve your chances of retiring with more money.</p><h3> <strong>6. The impact of inflation</strong></h3><p>Inflation erodes the purchasing power of your retirement savings because it costs more money to buy the things you need — everything from food and groceries to gasoline, clothing and entertainment. After years of low inflation, the U.S. economy has recently experienced an inflation spike. If this continues for a long period of time, it could jeopardize what your nest egg will enable you to purchase.</p><h2> How to increase your savings</h2><p>Asking <strong>if </strong>you can retire with $1 million presumes that you will be able to save $1 million in the first place.</p><p>Here are three steps to help you reach your goals and potentially increase your retirement savings:</p><h3> <strong>1. Aim to save 10% (or </strong> more<strong>!) of your annual pretax income for retirement. </strong></h3><p>This assumes an approximately 40- to 45-year working career during which you are actively saving money for your retirement, such as between ages 25and 67. If you participate in an <strong>employer-sponsored retirement plan</strong> at work — such as a 401(k) or 403(b) plan — and your employer matches your contributions, this could reduce the amount you need to save. Employer matches represent a boost on what you’re contributing, so it usually makes sense to contribute at least enough to an employer-sponsored retirement plan to qualify for a full match.</p><h3> 2. Leave your retirement savings alone<strong>. </strong></h3><p>One of the biggest hindrances to building your retirement savings is withdrawing money from your retirement account before you retire. Not only might you incur early withdrawal penalties, but you’ll miss out on potential long-term compounding of returns on your savings. Compounding is one of the biggest friends you may have when it comes to accumulating a retirement nest egg.</p><h2> Next steps for you</h2><p>Are you prepared for retirement? What lifestyle can you afford to maintain? Will moving out of state significantly alter your retirement potential? Find out for yourself if your retirement plan is on track.</p><p>The <strong>Empower Retirement Planner</strong> can help you determine how much money you may need to save for retirement. You can also evaluate alternative plans in order to determine if $1 million might be enough for you.</p><p>Talk to a financial professional for more detailed guidance on your retirement saving strategies.</p><p><sup>1 Go Banking Rates, “How Long $1 Million in Savings Will Last in Every State,” May 2022.</sup></p><p><sup>2 Smart Asset, “Asset Allocation in Retirement: 2022 Guide,” May 2022.</sup></p><p><sup>3 HealthView Services, “Retirement Healthcare Costs Data Report,” 2021.</sup></p><p><sup>4 Social Security Administration, Period Life Table, 2019.</sup></p><p><sup>The content contained in this blog post is intended for general informational purposes only and is not meant to constitute legal, tax, accounting or investment advice.

Others are transitioning to remote or hybrid work. Dining out, going to shows and taking vacations may not be happening with the same frequency — but the grocery bill sure has shot up. Inflation is also soaring to new highs.<sup>1,2</sup></p><h2> Why is budgeting important?</h2><p>Online banking, budgeting software and personal finance apps have made money management easier than ever. People can now categorize and track monthly expenses in a streamlined update to spreadsheets and the paper balance sheet. Still, good budgets are famously hard to create and even harder to stick to.</p><p>Other than a few expenses that happen on a regular basis like your car payment, housing expenses or student loans, it can be hard to predict how much you’re likely to spend on variable expenses in a given month. August or September mean back-to-school gear for the kids. December is gift-buying time. There are birthdays and holidays. It’s often difficult to determine how much money you will use for discretionary spending.</p><p>Remember, it’s okay to adjust your budget throughout the year or as changes happen. But good savings habits, both in the short run with an emergency fund and long run with retirement savings, helps make your budget more resilient and adaptable.</p><p>While budgeting tools are definitely useful, what’s ultimately most important is that you have a sense of your overall saving and spending habits. How does your monthly income balance out against your monthly expenses?</p><p>If your spending — or take-home earnings — come from more than one source, it can be hard to keep track of your net savings.</p><p>The key to mastering your finances is having a holistic view of everything related to your money — your spending and saving habits, your income sources and your investments. In this article, we’ll show you how to create a realistic budget that you can stick to with the Empower dashboard.</p><h2> How to create a budget</h2><p>Having a holistic view of your finances in one centralized location is a great first step to mastering your household budget.</p><p>With the Empower dashboard, you can plug in all of your investment and bank accounts — checking, saving, credit cards, 401(k), 529 accounts, loans and investments. This gives you a real sense of how your bottom line has moved by the end of the month.</p><p>What do all of your monthly expenses — the mortgage, bills, student loan payments, car payments and groceries — look like against all of your earnings?</p><h2> How to budget using Empower</h2><p>Your monthly income vs. monthly expenses statistics are front and center when you log in to your Empower dashboard. You can flip back and forth between viewing your income and viewing expenses. For a deeper dive into each, you can get a more detailed view of your deposits, income and transactions.</p><p>The dashboard also shows you transactions from each of your financial accounts. It allows you to adjust the time frame and see which expenses or income take up a given percentage of your personal budget. A bar graph also shows income-vs-spending month by month.</p><p>Knowing your spending and saving habits, and understanding where your largest “hot spots” are, is a great springboard for getting a handle on your household budgeting.</p><p>This detailed view of all your finances and transactions will also allow you to determine a realistic monthly budget number. It’s easy to list off all your fixed expenses like rent, car payment, student loans and the like. It’s harder to get a handle on all of the variable spending that happens every month on your different cards and from your different accounts.</p><p>On the mobile and tablet app, spending is shown in the “Budgeting” view. A circle chart depicts your transactions by type (ATM withdrawals, groceries, bills, etc.). You can see which transactions account for a given percentage of your monthly budget.</p><p>If you want more control over organizing your transactions, you can categorize them either in general groups like “Entertainment” or “Food,” or in customizable fields like “Fido’s dog food” or “Yard Maintenance.” If you charge work expenses to your personal accounts, you can label transactions as reimbursable so they won’t count against your household budget.</p><p>If you’re looking for a place to park your cash, you may be interested in Empower Cash™. This online cash account is easy to use on the web or on mobile devices and has competitive FDIC insurance coverage.<sup>3</sup> There are also no hidden fees on the account.</p><h2> Our take</h2><p>With a 360-degree view of all spending and all income, you can focus on the most important part of responsible budgeting: helping ensure that you are saving more than you’re spending and considering how to invest your extra money.</p><p><sup>1 Pew Research Center, “COVID-19 Pandemic Continues To Reshape Work in America,” February 2022.</sup></p><p><sup>2 CNBC, “Inflation rose 9.1% in June, even more than expected, as consumer pressures intensify,” July 2022.</sup></p><p><sup>3 FDIC insurance up to $250,000 (including principal & interest) per depositor per program bank. The cash balance you place through the program is swept to one or more program banks where it earns a variable rate of interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance.

If you have deposits at a program bank, you should consider electing not to use that bank by following the opt out instructions we provide. If you do so, the aggregate amount of FDIC insurance available to you will be lower.

            "content_html": "<p>It’s a common question we get as financial professionals: What are the tax benefits of marriage?</p><p>As couples plan for their big day, the last thing most people think about is taxes. However, marriage can have a big impact on a couple’s financial situation, especially in how they file their tax returns and how much tax they’ll pay.</p><p>Depending on the circumstances, there can be significant tax benefits of marriage, but there can also be drawbacks. For many people, the main <strong> tax benefit</strong> of filing as a married couple is ease: They get to file a joint tax return, and sometimes, take more deductions.</p><p>Minimizing any potential negative tax implications of marriage requires advance planning — ideally, before you and your betrothed walk down the aisle and say “I do.”</p><p><em> Handling taxes is much easier with our Financial Dashboard, a free tool for managing your financial life in one place. </em></p><h2> What are the key benefits of married filing jointly?</h2><p>There are two main tax-filing options for married couples: Married Filing Jointly or Married Filing Separately.</p><p>For many couples, choosing to file jointly will result in the most tax benefits of marriage, including the following.</p><h3> • Standard deduction and other deductions and credits</h3><p>The standard deduction for a single person or a person filing as Married Filing Separately is the same. It is $12,950 for <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-provides-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2022\" > <strong>tax year 2022</strong> </a> .<sup>1</sup></p><p>When two individuals get married and decide to file jointly, their standard deductions combine, and their Married Filing Jointly standard deduction becomes $25,900 for 2022’s taxes.<sup>1</sup></p><p>So, the standard deduction for a married couple is not “higher”; it is the combination of the two single individuals’ standard deductions. The advantage to Married Filing Jointly comes in with <strong>tax credits</strong> available only to married couples. Married couples filing jointly may qualify for several tax credits they would not have if they filed separately, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, and American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Education Tax Credits.</p><h3> • Easier and less expensive filing</h3><p>Simply put, it generally takes less time and effort to file one tax return than it does to file two returns. And if you hire a professional accountant or CPA to do your taxes, it may be less expensive for that person to prepare one return than to prepare two returns.</p><h3> • Potential for a lower tax bracket</h3><p>Traditionally known as the “marriage penalty,” this is a scenario in which a married couple earning similar salaries is pushed into a higher tax bracket than if they remained single. Congress has largely eliminated this tax penalty by adjusting the tax brackets so that now the marriage penalty only hits the highest-earning couples.</p><p>The top bracket of 37% is an exception. This rate covers income over $523,601 for singles and married couples filing separately and income over $647,851 for married couples filing jointly. So a couple earning this much money could still be subject to the marriage penalty if they file separately.<sup>1</sup></p><h3> • Preservation of estate</h3><p>Married couples can leave an unlimited amount of money to their spouses without generating any estate tax. This can protect a wealthy decedent’s estate from taxation until the death of the surviving spouse.</p><h3> • Potential for higher IRA contributions</h3><p>Single individuals who aren’t working generally cannot contribute to an IRA. But if a couple is married and one spouse isn’t working, the non-working spouse can contribute to an IRA using joint income. An eligible married couple filing jointly can make IRA contributions to two separate IRAs, or one for each spouse.</p><p>In addition to these tax benefits, the financial benefits of marriage can include discounted auto and homeowner’s insurance, better rates on health insurance, and better rates and terms on loans and credit.</p><h2> What is the marriage penalty and the EITC?</h2><p>Keep in mind that low-earning couples could be hit with a marriage penalty if they claim the earned income tax credit (EITC). The EITC is a refundable tax credit available mainly to working parents with children.</p><p>This is because taxpayers are no longer eligible for the EITC once their income exceeds a certain level, which is based on how many children they have. For example, a married couple with one child will no longer qualify for the EITC once their income <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit-eitc\" > <strong>exceeds $49,622 for tax year 2022</strong> </a> .<sup>2</sup></p><p>Interestingly, to qualify for the EITC, the income limits for married taxpayers are not double those for single taxpayers. For example, the income limit for the 2022 tax year is $43,492 for a single taxpayer with one qualifying child, but only $49,622 <br/> for married taxpayers with one qualifying child.<sup>2</sup></p><h2> Investment income, Medicare taxes and SALT</h2><p>Something that might impact the tax benefits of marriage for high-earning couples is the potential for being penalized by having to pay the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/questions-and-answers-on-the-net-investment-income-tax\" > <strong>net investment income tax</strong> </a> of 3.8% and the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/what-is-the-additional-medicare-tax-and-who-pays-it#:~:text=The%20Additional%20Medicare%20Tax%20rate,more%20than%20a%20threshold%20amount.\" > <strong>Medicare surtax</strong> </a>of 0.9%.<sup>3,4</sup></p><p>Single filers aren’t subject to these taxes until their income exceeds $200,000, but the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/individuals/net-investment-income-tax\"> <strong>threshold for married couples filing jointly</strong> </a> is $250,000.<sup>4</sup></p><p>This means a couple would have a combined threshold of $400,000 if they remained single, but just $250,000 if they got married. If one spouse earns $150,000 and the other earns $100,000, they would not be subject to these taxes if they remained single, but they would be if they tied the knot. The threshold for married filing separately is $125,000.<sup>4</sup></p><p>Tax reform’s limit on the itemized deduction for state and local taxes (or more simply, <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/tax-basics/salt-deduction/\"> <strong>SALT</strong> </a> ) to $10,000 could also negatively impact couples who get married. This limit applies to both single filers and married couples filing jointly.<sup>5</sup></p><p>So, if each spouse has $10,000 in SALT and they get married, their total deduction will be just $10,000, not the combined $20,000 if they each remained single. Keep in mind that a married couple would need to have another $15,100 in itemized deductions for it to make sense to itemize rather than taking the standard deduction that has increased to $25,900 in 2022.<sup>5</sup></p><h2> Our take</h2><p>If you are recently married or plan to get married soon, you should consider meeting with a financial professional or tax advisor to talk about how your marriage could affect your tax situation. The sooner you plan, the better chance you’ll have of enjoying some of the tax benefits of marriage.</p><p><sup>1 IRS.gov, IRS provides tax inflation adjustments for tax year 2022, November 2021.</sup></p><p><sup>2 IRS.gov, Earned Income and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) Tables, August 2022.</sup></p><p><sup>3 IRS.gov, Questions and Answers on the Net Investment Income Tax, September 2022.</sup></p><p><sup>4 IRS.gov, What is the Additional Medicare Tax and Who Pays It, March 2022.</sup></p><p><sup>5 TaxFoundation.org, State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction, 2022.</sup></p><p><sup>The content contained in this blog post is intended for general informational purposes only and is not meant to constitute legal, tax, accounting or investment advice.

Anyone earning a $100,000 salary then would have been living like millionaires do today.</p><p>Despite multiple recessions and changing attitudes around money, most Americans still aspire to hit the $100,000 income benchmark. However, a convergence of economic and financial factors has fundamentally changed what it means to rake in a six-figure salary.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/study/paycheck-to-paycheck-consumer-finances-american-households/\" > PYMNTS and LendingClub </a> reported that 60% of U.S. millennials earning over $100,000 a year said they’re living paycheck to paycheck.<sup>1</sup> Some of this might be explained by misguided money management, but that’s hardly the case for every six-figure earner.</p><h2> Why six figures isn’t what it used to be</h2><p>Earning a six-figure salary may still be a sign of status and success, but it comes up short in guaranteeing a comfortable lifestyle in many parts of the country.</p><p>A 2020 <a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/economy/true-cost-american-dream-every-state/\" > analysis by GOBankingRates </a>questioned whether the American dream was still affordable in any state. <sup>2</sup> Researchers tallied necessary living expenses — including housing, healthcare, education, childcare and food — plus discretionary expenses and a healthy 20% savings rate for a married couple with two children, a pet and a house. They found that it takes between about $108,000 annually (in Mississippi) and nearly $207,000 annually (in Hawaii) to achieve this version of the American dream.</p><p>So, what has changed? According to the experts, a whole lot. Here are a few reasons why a $100,000 salary doesn’t go as far as it used to.</p><h2> <strong>Student debt</strong></h2><p>Higher education is most often the ticket to a well-paying job. The typical college-educated worker earns $1 million more than a worker whose highest degree is a high school diploma <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/who-owes-all-that-student-debt-and-whod-benefit-if-it-were-forgiven/\" > according to the Brookings Institute </a> .<sup>3</sup> But the cost of earning a college degree has become increasingly unaffordable.</p><p>Today, Americans collectively owe more than $1.7 trillion in student loans, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=SLOAS,\"> according to the Federal Reserve of St. Louis </a> .<sup>4</sup> That’s double the amount owed just a decade ago.</p><p>Most borrowers pay hundreds or thousands of dollars a month to their student loan providers. With a six-figure income, the less likely you are to qualify for lower payments or other relief.</p><h2> <strong>Inflation</strong></h2><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics offers plenty of useful data on inflation rates over the years, including <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\"> this Consumer Price Index inflation calculator </a> . Play around with it and you’ll see that a modern family would need to earn over 50% more money in 2021 than they did in 2000 to keep pace with inflation.</p><p>Put another way, it would take $158,959 today to achieve the same kind of lifestyle that $100,000 afforded in 2000.</p><p>Unfortunately, wages haven’t kept up with inflation. This visualization <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/nominal-wage-tracker/\"> from the Economic Policy Institute </a> shows the current average hourly wages of all non-government employees ($30.96) versus where wages would be if they had kept up with inflation ($34.09). There’s a gap of more than $3 an hour — or about $126 over the course of a 40-hour work week.</p><p>Mind the wage gap <br/> Cumulative nominal average hourly earnings, actual and hypothetical, if they had grown at 3.5% since the recession began, 2007-2022.</p><p><img border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/static/images/emp/feed/six-figure-salary/mind-the-wage-gap.png\" alt=\"Graphical user interface, line chartDescription automatically generated\" /></p><p>This chart illustrates the price changes of selected consumer goods and services <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/price-changes-in-consumer-goods-and-services-in-the-usa-1997-2017?time=2000..latest&amp;country=~USA\" > using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics </a> .</p><p>As you can see, recurring costs — many of which families consider a necessity — like college tuition, childcare and healthcare have risen dramatically. Meanwhile, the only items to become markedly cheaper or remain the same price are discretionary, like toys, clothing and TVs.</p><p><img border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/static/images/emp/feed/six-figure-salary/price-changes.png\" alt=\"Graphical user interface, chartDescription automatically generated\" /></p><h2> <strong>Housing</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.empower.com/empower-insights/what-kind-of-home-should-i-buy\" > Homeownership </a> is a cornerstone of the American dream, but it’s harder than ever to get a foot in the door.</p><p>A six-figure income may still go quite far for those putting down roots in the South or the Midwest. But in large cities and coastal areas, the cost of real estate has escalated dramatically since the Great Recession. U.S. home values rose 18.4% from just September 2020 to 2021 thanks to a housing market boom brought on by the pandemic.</p><p>The median price of a home nationally was about $404,700 in the third quarter of 2021, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS\"> according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis </a> .<sup>5 </sup>In San Francisco, one of the most expensive large cities in the U.S., the median home sold for over $1.5 million, <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/city/17151/CA/San-Francisco/housing-market\"> per Redfin </a> .<sup>6 </sup>Higher home values also lead to higher property taxes.</p><p>But it’s not just ownership that’s eating into people’s salaries. Rents across the country were rising steadily before the pandemic and have taken a sharp turn upward since then.</p><h2> <strong>Kids</strong></h2><p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/01/13/cost-raising-child\"> 2015 U.S. Department of Agriculture report </a> ,<sup>7 </sup>the cost of raising a child from birth to age 17 seven years ago had grown to a staggering $233,610 (now $261,473 when you factor in inflation). That figure includes shelter, education and daycare — items that have become significantly pricier over the past few decades.</p><p>Help in the form of college aid and subsidized daycare is often not an option for families who bring in six-figure incomes, making it harder for them to absorb such costs and still come out ahead. The current Child Tax Credit offers advanced cash payments only to couples making less than $200,000 and single parents making less than $100,000.</p><p>Raising a child is a huge expense, to be sure, but the true cost varies by family, geographic location and lifestyle.</p><h2> <strong>Healthcare</strong></h2><p>Little else has eroded the buying power of a six-figure salary like the cost of healthcare. The amount individuals spend on healthcare in the U.S. nearly doubled from $2,574 in 2004 to $4,968 in 2018, adjusting for inflation, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-9/how-have-healthcare-expenditures-changed-evidence-from-the-consumer-expenditure-surveys.htm#_edn1\" > according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics </a> .<sup>8</sup></p><p>Overall, the change in price for healthcare services since 1983 has outpaced the total price increase for all goods and services. The BLS says that greater availability and quality of healthcare services and new technological innovations are responsible for the cost inflation.</p><p>The enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, also known as Obamacare, underscored the notion that families with six-figure incomes should be able to cover their family’s healthcare, whatever the cost. The law disallows subsidies ( <a href=\"https://www.healthinsurance.org/obamacare/beware-obamacares-subsidy-cliff/\" > except for the 2021 and 2022 coverage years </a> ) for families earning at least 400% of the Federal Poverty Limit, or around $104,800 for a family of four in 2021.</p><p>The following chart illustrates the share of adults who reported struggling with the cost of healthcare in 2019:</p><p><img border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/static/images/emp/feed/six-figure-salary/some-insured.png\" alt=\"Graphical user interface, applicationDescription automatically generated\" /></p><h2> How to stretch a six-figure salary even further</h2><p>It’s important to note that while a low six-figure salary might not go as far as it used to, it’s still much more than the U.S. household median income of $67,521.</p><p>If you’re feeling stretched on a six-figure income, here are some tips for making it work:</p><ul type=\"disc\"> <li> <strong>Live a frugal lifestyle. </strong> The key to making the most of a $100,000 (or higher) salary is spending less than you earn. Keep an eye on the three largest <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/how-to-stay-in-the-black-focus-on-cash-flow/\" > budget line items </a> : housing, transportati006Fn and food. If you can manage to keep these costs lower than average, you should be able to free up more money for things you actually want to spend your money on. <br/> <br/> </li> <li> <strong>Invest frequently.</strong> Investing in tax-advantaged accounts is one way to lower your tax liability now and prepare for retirement in the future. Utilizing a <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/401k-calculator-how-much-should-you-have-saved/\" > 401(k </a> ), <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/roth-ira-rules/\" > IRA </a> or <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/sep-ira/\" > self-employed retirement account </a> usually means saving some of your income before you pay taxes on it, which helps if you’re creeping toward a higher tax bracket. You’ll be locking up your funds for several years but also supercharging the potential growth of your balance. <br/> <br/> </li> <li> <strong>Work with a financial advisor.</strong> One thing many rich people have in common? They consult experts to <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management\"> make the most of their wealth </a> . If you’re angling to maximize your six-figure salary, find a financial advisor you trust to point out your blind spots, offer conflict-free advice and help you strategize to meet your unique financial goals. </li></ul><p>And that’s not all you can do to ensure a six-figure income actually helps you get ahead. Don’t feel like your earnings are enough? Consider changing jobs, consulting on the side or finally launching that side hustle you work on in your spare time. Struggling to get by in a high-cost area? Consider whether it makes sense to move to a new city or to the suburbs.</p><p>A six-figure salary is no longer a guarantee of financial success — and it hasn’t been for a while. With the cost of living in America rising still further, it’s time to be strategic about the money you bring in.</p><h2> The bottom line</h2><p>Managing your monthly spending and savings is just one part of your overall financial plan.
