            "content": "This article was originally published July 18, 2022.\nKey Takeaways\n\nMore than 75% of Americans fear a recession will happen within the next two years, with 44% of Generation Z thinking it will happen by the end of 2022.*\n62% of Americans would invest in stocks during a recession, and 49% said they would invest in crypto.\nAmericans say they became more financially conscious in the last year due to COVID-19 (61%) and inflation (47%).\nYouTube was the top choice for recession education and preparation for over half of all respondents (56%).\n\n\nBracing for the Next Economic Downturn\nWith\u00a0 the Great Recession of 2008 barely in the rearview mirror, many people remember it as the harshest economic downturn since the Great Depression. Today, with pandemic recovery, the invasion of Ukraine, and rising inflation, many people are worried there might be another recession on the horizon. To brace themselves people are taking actions to shore up their finances.\nWe recently surveyed over 1,000 Americans* to learn more about how prepared they are to face another recession. They shared their greatest recession fears, best investment strategies, and biggest motivations to act swiftly and smartly with their finances. Older generations also imparted some sage advice, and we\u2019ve noted the top resources Americans use to educate themselves on financial planning. Read on to learn more about how Americans devise plans to keep their money safe and their futures secure.\nRecession Incoming?\nThere\u2019s a looming sense of fear among some Americans that a recession might be right around the corner. How many people think one will come to fruition within the next couple of years or by this year\u2019s end? Let\u2019s look at their predictions and what each generation fears the most.\n\nMore than three-quarters of Americans are bracing for a potential recession within the next two years. Most people think that it\u2019ll happen sooner rather than later. They aren\u2019t alone in this fear, as most economists and investors agree a recession will likely hit the U.S. in 2023.\nThere\u2019s no discernible age group among the generations that is more or less worried than another about an upcoming recession. Although, Gen Z was slightly more likely to think one would happen this year. The scariest aspect of a recession for the youngest Americans was that they might lose their jobs. Millennials and Gen Xers most feared getting behind on their bills and being unable to pay them. Baby boomers\u2019 biggest worry was needing to withdraw funds from their retirement savings.\nDespite the consensus of a looming recession, respondents are still planning to make financial investments in the stock market, real estate, and cryptocurrency. More than half of respondents (52%) said they would use a recession to their advantage and buy their first home. Gen Zers (64%) and millennials (55%) were the most likely to say they would do so. While self-managing your investments is common, a professional financial advisor can help guide you through investment options and decisions.\n\nFinancial Lessons: Pandemic Edition\nThe financial impact of recessions can be devastating \u2014 how many Americans are financially ready to deal with another one? Here\u2019s a look at who\u2019s financially secure and how much they\u2019ve saved to feel this way.\n\nNearly half of respondents felt financially secure enough to survive another recession. On average, Americans have saved $7,586 for an emergency. Gen Zers felt safest, while millennials were the shakiest. Interestingly, Gen Z had the least amount saved ($5,817). Baby boomers had the most emergency savings ($9,337).\nThe global pandemic caused many to be more financially conscious of their spending habits in the last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic (61%) and inflation (47%).\nMaking a concerted effort to increase savings, contributing to an emergency fund, and learning how to budget more effectively were the top lessons learned from the pandemic. People who were given financial advice throughout the pandemic were more likely to experience a positive financial impact. This help came from their workplace, a dedicated financial advisor, or online money management tools.\nRecession-Related Words of Wisdom\nWhat suggestions can older generations (baby boomers and Gen X) give younger Americans (Gen Z and millennials) to put them in the best position to succeed financially?\n\nFrom Gen Xers and Baby Boomers to younger generations, the biggest piece of advice they hit home was to increase savings and learn how to budget. Millennials and Gen Zers have taken the \u201cincrease my savings\u201d suggestion to heart but prioritized maintaining a stable job more than taking a budgeting crash course.\n\nAmong all the generations, YouTube was one of the top three resources for recession preparation/education purposes and the first stop for everyone but baby boomers. Perhaps its accessibility and the fact that it\u2019s free is what made YouTube the top choice across all generations.\nMeanwhile, Millennials and Baby Boomers used financial service companies for recession preparation and education. Working with a financial advisor proved a major success: 78% of Americans reported feeling more financially secure and prepared for whatever lies ahead because of their advisor\u2019s help.\nIf you\u2019re interested in speaking with a financial planner for the first time or looking for a switch, it\u2019s important to find the right match. Ask potential advisors about their qualifications and experience working with clientele in relatable stages of their financial journey, share your money goals and ask how they can help. The answers to these questions, and more, can set the stage for advice tailored to your specific needs.\n\u00a0\nMethodology\nPersonal Capital commissioned a Fractl survey of 1,002 Americans about their financial habits and how they\u2019re preparing for a recession. 16% of respondents were Generation Z, 48% were Millennials, 25% Generation X, and 11% were Baby Boomers. The survey was conducted in May, 2022.\nFor short, open-ended questions, outliers were removed. Survey data has certain limitations related to self-reporting. These limitations include telescoping, exaggeration, and selective memory. The margin of error was 3%, with a confidence level of 95%.\nAbout Personal Capital\nPersonal Capital is a digital wealth management company that helps people transform their lives through technology and personalized advice.

            "content": "If you\u2019ve done any reading on budgeting apps, you\u2019ve almost certainly come across Mint and You Need a Budget (YNAB). These apps are two of the most popular budgeting tools on the market.\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a new budgeting app, Mint and YNAB may be two of the options you\u2019re considering. And many users find themselves wondering which is better. In this comparison, we\u2019ll discuss the differences and similarities between Mint and YNAB, as well as how to decide which is right for you.\nAre Mint and YNAB (You Need a Budget) the Same?\nWhen you\u2019re shopping around for budgeting apps, it\u2019s easy to feel like each option is pretty much the same, just with a different interface and slightly different features. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth with Mint and YNAB.\nNot only are Mint and YNAB two different companies, but the two apps take two entirely different approaches to budgeting. On the one hand, this can make it easier to choose between them since they are so different. However, some people may struggle to choose between the two apps, especially if they\u2019re new to budgeting and aren\u2019t sure which method is best for them.\nMint, which is owned by the company Intuit, provides a simple framework to help you create a monthly budget and track your spending.\nYou Need a Budget \u2014 more commonly known as YNAB \u2014 is a budgeting app that helps you to be more proactive and intentional with your spending. Rather than just having you create a budget framework that stays the same from one month to the next, it takes a zero-based budgeting approach to help you budget only the money you have.\nGet a handle on your money with Personal Capital\u2019s free financial dashboard. You get a quick overview of your net worth, budget and cash flow, investment allocation, and more. You can also plan for long-term goals like retirement.\nYNAB vs. Mint: Key Similarities\nAs we mentioned, YNAB and Mint have some key differences. However, let\u2019s start by breaking down the similarities between the two budgeting apps.\nBudgeting\nAt their core, YNAB and Mint are both budgeting tools designed to help you set and stick to your budget. Both services allow you to create a target spending amount for each category in your budget. Additionally, each service allows you to track your spending throughout the month to ensure you\u2019re staying on track.\nLinked Accounts\nBoth YNAB and Mint allow you to connect your budgeting account with your other financial accounts, including your checking and savings accounts, credit cards, loans, and more. These linked accounts make it easy to automatically import and track your expenses, which we\u2019ll talk more about below.\nWhile both accounts allow you to link your accounts, both also allow you to set up a budget and track your expenses without linked accounts. However, YNAB is the only tool that is really designed for this purpose. Users who don\u2019t want to link accounts may find Mint difficult to use.\nDevice Compatibility\nNo matter what type of device you use, either Mint or YNAB should work for you. Both services allow you to manage your budget directly from their website. Additionally, each has an app for both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.\nOther Features\nIn addition to their budgeting features, YNAB and Mint also have a few other important features in common:\n\nExpense tracking: As we mentioned, once you link your accounts, both YNAB and Mint will automatically import your expenses. You can categorize these expenses manually in the beginning, and then the apps will automatically categorize them. As expenses come in, both budgeting apps will automatically subtract that amount from your remaining funds available to a specific budgeting category. For example, when one of the apps records a $100 restaurant transaction, it will subtract $100 from your dining out budget.\nNet worth tracking: Another feature that both apps offer is the ability to track your net worth. To do this, both apps use your linked accounts. Your linked checking, savings, and investment accounts make up your assets, while your linked debt accounts make up your liabilities. It\u2019s important to note that each app can only accurately track your net worth if you\u2019ve added all of your assets and liabilities, either by linking them or by manually adding them.\nGoals tracking: Both YNAB and Mint allow you to set financial goals and track your progress along the way. Whether you\u2019re working to pay off debt or save for a large expense, each budgeting app has a feature to help you.\n\nYNAB vs. Mint: Key Differences\nEven more important than YNAB and Mint\u2019s similarities are their differences, these differences are what will set the two apps apart and help you decide which is best for you.\nBudgeting Approach\nThe most important difference between Mint and YNAB is their approach to budgeting.\nMint takes a fairly traditional approach to budgeting. When you set up your account, you\u2019ll be able to establish the spending targets that will follow you through each and every month. You\u2019ll tell Mint your income and expenses for the month, and it will tell you whether you\u2019re sticking to your goals, whether your expenses are realistic based on your income, and how much you have left to spend for the month.\nYNAB takes a very different approach to budgeting because it only allows you to budget with the money you actually have. Like Mint, YNAB allows you to set certain spending targets for each category in your budget. But then, you\u2019ll only be able to budget what\u2019s in your bank account.\nFor example, suppose you get paid twice per month, each paycheck worth $2,000. When you receive your first paycheck, YNAB will show that you have $2,000 to assign to categories. Once you\u2019ve budgeted out the entire $2,000, you won\u2019t be able to budget anymore. Instead, you\u2019ll have to wait until you have more money hit your account.\nIt may seem like YNAB\u2019s budgeting approach would be more difficult since you can\u2019t budget for the entire month at a time. Instead, YNAB encourages users to budget ahead. The goal is to slowly get ahead in your budget until you\u2019re always using this month\u2019s income to pay for next month\u2019s expenses.\nEase of Use\nMint and YNAB have two very different learning curves. Mint requires considerably less effort on the part of the user. When you first set up your account, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to create your target budget and link your accounts.\nFrom there, almost everything in Mint happens automatically. The same target budget carries forward from one month to the next, and your transactions are automatically imported and categorized to ensure you\u2019re staying on track. For users who want a set-it-and-forget-it system, Mint definitely provides that.\nYNAB, on the other hand, has a considerable learning curve. First, you can\u2019t simply set up your budget and watch it run on autopilot. Instead, you have to budget each dollar as it comes in. And it can be confusing to learn how YNAB works when it comes to setting up your spending targets, budgeting your income, rolling money over to the following month, and more.\nYNAB is a far more hands-on approach to budgeting, and it\u2019s designed that way on purpose. If you\u2019re someone who has previously enjoyed using a spreadsheet to track your expenses and spending a lot of time in your budget, you will probably appreciate YNAB.\nOther Features and Services\nAnother important difference between Mint and YNAB is the other services and features they offer. YNAB has a more robust budgeting system, but Mint has a few other features for users to enjoy. These features include:\n\nBill tracking: Mint offers a bill tracker that lets you know how much you\u2019re paying to each company and on which date. Each month, you can look in your Mint app to see which bills are coming up. You\u2019ll also be notified if any of your bills have increased and if Mint detects any added fees.\nSubscription management: In addition to tracking your other bills, Mint also makes it easy to manage your subscriptions. You can see a roundup of each subscription you pay for and how much it costs you each month or year.\nCredit score monitoring: When you have a Mint account, you\u2019ll also get free credit score monitoring. You can see your score at any time, see the different factors affecting your score, and get tips on how to improve your score. You\u2019ll also receive notifications when something changes on your credit report.\n\nCost\nA final important difference between Mint and YNAB is their costs. Mint has a free version that includes nearly all of its features. However, you can also upgrade to a paid subscription to access an ad-free experience, spending projections, subscription cancellation, and more. You\u2019ll pay $0.99 to upgrade to an ad-free experience and $4.99 per month for all of Mint\u2019s premium features.\nUnlike Mint, YNAB has a subscription model, and after your free trial, you\u2019ll have to pay to use it. First, you can choose the monthly plan at a price tag of $14.99 per month. You can also switch to an annual plan for $98.99 per year, which offers $80 in savings.\nYNAB vs. Mint Alternatives\nYNAB and Mint are two of the most popular budgeting apps on the market, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. Some of the other top budgeting apps on the market include Tiller Money, EveryDollar, Quicken, and more. If you\u2019re looking for alternatives to Mind and YNAB, then we\u2019ll dive into how they compare to Personal Capital\u2019s budgeting features below.\nMint and YNAB vs. Personal Capital\nPersonal Capital is similar to Mint and YNAB in that they all allow you to set up your monthly budget, link your accounts to track your spending, track your net worth, and more.\nBut there are also some important differences. At their core, Mint and YNAB are designed for budgeting. Each has robust budgeting features, despite using different budgeting methods. Mint offers a set-it-and-forget-it budgeting tool that allows you to set your target budget once and then use it over and over again each month. YNAB, on the other hand, uses a zero-based budgeting approach that requires you to be more proactive and hands-on with where your money is going.\nPersonal Capital also offers a budgeting tool that makes it easy to connect your bank accounts, track your spending, and see how your income and expenses compare.\nBut unlike Mint and YNAB, Personal Capital really shines in areas beyond budgeting. Instead, the financial dashboard is designed to help you track your investments and net worth. In addition to being able to track the spending in your checking account, you\u2019ll also be able to track your investment performance. The dashboard also includes other tools to help you manage your finances, including a retirement planner, savings planner, investment fee analyzer, and more.\nGet Started with Personal Capital\u2019s Free Financial Tools\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAuthor is not a client of Personal Capital Advisors Corporation and is compensated as a freelance writer.\nThe content contained in this blog post is intended for general informational purposes only and is not meant to constitute legal, tax, accounting or investment advice.

These apps are two of the most popular budgeting tools on the market.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re in the market for a new budgeting app, Mint and YNAB may be two of the options you\u2019re considering. And many users find themselves wondering which is better. In this comparison, we\u2019ll discuss the differences and similarities between Mint and YNAB, as well as how to decide which is right for you.</p>\n<h2>Are Mint and YNAB (You Need a Budget) the Same?</h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re shopping around for budgeting apps, it\u2019s easy to feel like each option is pretty much the same, just with a different interface and slightly different features. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth with Mint and YNAB.</p>\n<p>Not only are Mint and YNAB two different companies, but the two apps take two entirely different approaches to budgeting. On the one hand, this can make it easier to choose between them since they are so different. However, some people may struggle to choose between the two apps, especially if they\u2019re new to budgeting and aren\u2019t sure which method is best for them.</p>\n<p>Mint, which is owned by the company Intuit, provides a simple framework to help you <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/how-to-stay-in-the-black-focus-on-cash-flow/\">create a monthly budget</a> and track your spending.</p>\n<p>You Need a Budget \u2014 more commonly known as YNAB \u2014 is a budgeting app that helps you to be more proactive and intentional with your spending. Rather than just having you create a budget framework that stays the same from one month to the next, it takes a zero-based budgeting approach to help you budget only the money you have.</p>\n<div class=\"pc-tip-container\"><img src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/themes/PersonalCapital-v5/img/tip.svg\" alt=\"\" width=\"45\" height=\"29\" class=\"tip-icon\"/><div class=\"inner\">Get a handle on your money with Personal Capital\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software\"> <strong>free financial dashboard</strong></a>.

You can also plan for long-term goals like retirement.</div></div>\n<h2>YNAB vs. Mint: Key Similarities</h2>\n<p>As we mentioned, YNAB and Mint have some key differences. However, let\u2019s start by breaking down the similarities between the two budgeting apps.</p>\n<h3>Budgeting</h3>\n<p>At their core, YNAB and Mint are both budgeting tools designed to help you set and stick to your budget. Both services allow you to create a target spending amount for each category in your budget. Additionally, each service allows you to track your spending throughout the month to ensure you\u2019re staying on track.</p>\n<h3>Linked Accounts</h3>\n<p>Both YNAB and Mint allow you to connect your budgeting account with your other financial accounts, including your checking and savings accounts, credit cards, loans, and more. These linked accounts make it easy to automatically import and track your expenses, which we\u2019ll talk more about below.</p>\n<p>While both accounts allow you to link your accounts, both also allow you to set up a budget and track your expenses without linked accounts. However, YNAB is the only tool that is really designed for this purpose. Users who don\u2019t want to link accounts may find Mint difficult to use.</p>\n<h3>Device Compatibility</h3>\n<p>No matter what type of device you use, either Mint or YNAB should work for you. Both services allow you to manage your budget directly from their website. Additionally, each has an app for both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.</p>\n<h3>Other Features</h3>\n<p>In addition to their budgeting features, YNAB and Mint also have a few other important features in common:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expense tracking: </strong>As we mentioned, once you link your accounts, both YNAB and Mint will automatically import your expenses. You can categorize these expenses manually in the beginning, and then the apps will automatically categorize them. As expenses come in, both budgeting apps will automatically subtract that amount from your remaining funds available to a specific budgeting category. For example, when one of the apps records a $100 restaurant transaction, it will subtract $100 from your dining out budget.</li>\n<li><strong>Net worth tracking:</strong> Another feature that both apps offer is the ability to <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/net-worth\">track your net worth</a>. To do this, both apps use your linked accounts. Your linked checking, savings, and investment accounts make up your assets, while your linked debt accounts make up your liabilities. It\u2019s important to note that each app can only accurately track your net worth if you\u2019ve added all of your assets and liabilities, either by linking them or by manually adding them.</li>\n<li><strong>Goals tracking:</strong> Both YNAB and Mint allow you to set financial goals and track your progress along the way. Whether you\u2019re working to pay off debt or save for a large expense, each budgeting app has a feature to help you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>YNAB vs. Mint: Key Differences</h2>\n<p>Even more important than YNAB and Mint\u2019s similarities are their differences, these differences are what will set the two apps apart and help you decide which is best for you.</p>\n<h3>Budgeting Approach</h3>\n<p>The most important difference between Mint and YNAB is their approach to budgeting.</p>\n<p>Mint takes a fairly traditional approach to budgeting.

            "content": "Wealth Management vs Investment Banking: An Overview\nWealth management and investment banking are two of the most important functions of the financial industry. They\u2019re also two of the more lucrative job opportunities, allowing you to play a vital role in the industry while earning a healthy salary.\nWhile wealth management and investment banking are very similar, they actually have two very different functions and different responsibilities. If you\u2019re considering pursuing a career in either wealth management or investment banking, this guide can help you choose between them.\nWealth Management\nWealth management is a faction of financial services designed to serve individuals \u2014 usually high-net-worth individuals. Wealth management includes portfolio management, meaning financial professionals help plan their client\u2019s asset allocations and manage their portfolios.\nWealth management is usually a form of comprehensive financial planning, meaning it combines portfolio management with a wide variety of other financial services. Other services a wealth manager is likely to provide include cash flow management, tax planning, insurance planning, estate planning, and more.\nWealth managers can work for larger firms or for themselves to serve high net worth clients. They are often paid as a percentage of assets managed \u2014 usually around 1%. Wealth managers can also earn a commission for the financial products they recommend to their clients.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, personal financial advisors, which include wealth managers, earn a median annual salary of $94,170, which is considerably higher than the national average. That being said, the highest-paid 10% of advisors earn more than $200,000.\nLooking for a better way to manage your own investments? Millions of people use Personal Capital\u2019s free and secure online financial tools to see all of their accounts in one place, analyze their investments, and plan for long-term goals, like buying a house or saving for retirement.\nInvestment Banking\nInvestment banking is a specific financial service where professionals help corporations, governments, and other entities raise capital.\nFirst, investment bankers help organizations issue debt securities like bonds. They also help underwrite equity securities (aka stocks) for publicly-traded companies. For example, if a large company wanted to issue an initial public offering (IPO), it would hire investment bankers to underwrite the securities and market them to the public.\nInvestment bankers also help companies undergo mergers and acquisitions. If one company is planning to purchase another, it would likely hire investment bankers to do its due diligence, help with the valuation, assist in writing the contracts, and help see the deal through to the end.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for professionals involved in securities, commodities contracts, and other financial investments and related activities is $98,030. However, the highest-paid 10% of professionals earn more than $200,000 per year.\nSpecial Considerations\nWealth management and investment banking are two of the most popular careers for professionals in the financial services industry. Both offer high pay and exciting opportunities, and each one has some pros and cons to know about.\nFirst, investment banking and wealth management do have some advantages in common. First, both have high earning potential, which allows professionals in the field to earn a median of nearly six figures. And if you live in a high cost of living area or are one of the top in your field, the earning potential is far greater.\nBoth also have the advantage of not requiring an advanced degree. Yes, you might advance further in your career with a master\u2019s degree or higher, but you can earn a living as a wealth manager or investment banker with just a bachelor\u2019s degree.\nThe two careers also have some important differences that might help differentiate them. First, when it comes to work-life balance, wealth management is the clear winner. In most cases, wealth managers work normal business hours, with work weeks ranging from 40 to 50 hours.\nThe work-life balance isn\u2019t quite as attractive for investment bankers. These professionals work in a faster-paced environment and often work upwards of 80 hours per week. If you want to advance in the industry, you\u2019ll have to accept those long hours.\nA final difference between the two to consider is the work environment. Wealth managers often work for large firms and may work somewhat collaboratively with colleagues. However, the job primarily involves working with individuals to manage their finances.\nWhen it comes to investment banking, you aren\u2019t working with individuals. Instead, you work directly with corporations and government entities looking to raise capital. Investment banking is also a collaborative effort. Investment bankers don\u2019t generally work alone with their clients. Instead, they work on teams that often involve not only investment bankers, attorneys, and other professionals from their own firm, but from other firms as well.\nWhich One is Right For You?\nIf you\u2019re considering a career in financial services, wealth management and investment banking are two excellent options. Both require similar levels of skill and education and offer similar earning potential.\nWhen deciding between these two careers, the most important things to consider are your desired work environment and work hours. If you want more work-life balance and the opportunity to work with individual clients, wealth management is probably right for you. On the other hand, if you want a fast-paced work environment where you work potentially long hours, consider a career in investment banking.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAuthor is not a client of Personal Capital Advisors Corporation and is compensated as a freelance writer.\nThe content contained in this blog post is intended for general informational purposes only and is not meant to constitute legal, tax, accounting or investment advice.

Other services a wealth manager is likely to provide include cash flow management, tax planning, insurance planning, estate planning, and more.</p>\n<p>Wealth managers can work for larger firms or for themselves to serve high <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/\">net worth</a> clients. They are often paid as a percentage of assets managed \u2014 usually around 1%. Wealth managers can also earn a commission for the financial products they recommend to their clients.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/personal-financial-advisors.htm#tab-5\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, personal financial advisors, which include wealth managers, earn a median annual salary of $94,170, which is considerably higher than the national average. That being said, the highest-paid 10% of advisors earn more than $200,000.</p>\n<div class=\"pc-tip-container\"><img src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/themes/PersonalCapital-v5/img/tip.svg\" alt=\"\" width=\"45\" height=\"29\" class=\"tip-icon\"/><div class=\"inner\">Looking for a better way to manage your own investments? Millions of people use Personal Capital\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/is-personal-capital-free/\"> free</a> and<a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/is-personal-capital-safe/\"> secure</a> online financial tools to see all of their accounts in one place, analyze their investments, and plan for long-term goals, like<a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/what-do-i-need-to-buy-a-house/\"> buying a house</a> or<a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/best-ways-to-save-for-retirement/\"> saving for retirement</a>.</div></div>\n<h3>Investment Banking</h3>\n<p>Investment banking is a specific financial service where professionals help corporations, governments, and other entities raise capital.</p>\n<p>First, investment bankers help organizations issue debt securities like bonds. They also help underwrite equity securities (aka stocks) for publicly-traded companies. For example, if a large company wanted to issue an <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/how-does-ipo-work/\">initial public offering (IPO)</a>, it would hire investment bankers to underwrite the securities and market them to the public.</p>\n<p>Investment bankers also help companies undergo mergers and acquisitions. If one company is planning to purchase another, it would likely hire investment bankers to do its due diligence, help with the valuation, assist in writing the contracts, and help see the deal through to the end.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/sales/securities-commodities-and-financial-services-sales-agents.htm#tab-5https://www.bls.gov/ooh/sales/securities-commodities-and-financial-services-sales-agents.htm#tab-5\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, the median annual salary for professionals involved in securities, commodities contracts, and other financial investments and related activities is $98,030. However, the highest-paid 10% of professionals earn more than $200,000 per year.</p>\n<h2>Special Considerations</h2>\n<p>Wealth management and investment banking are two of the most popular careers for professionals in the financial services industry. Both offer high pay and exciting opportunities, and each one has some pros and cons to know about.</p>\n<p>First, investment banking and wealth management do have some advantages in common. First, both have high earning potential, which allows professionals in the field to earn a median of nearly six figures. And if you live in a high cost of living area or are one of the top in your field, the earning potential is far greater.</p>\n<p>Both also have the advantage of not requiring an advanced degree. Yes, you might advance further in your career with a master\u2019s degree or higher, but you can earn a living as a wealth manager or investment banker with just a bachelor\u2019s degree.</p>\n<p>The two careers also have some important differences that might help differentiate them. First, when it comes to work-life balance, wealth management is the clear winner. In most cases, wealth managers work normal business hours, with work weeks ranging from 40 to 50 hours.</p>\n<p>The work-life balance isn\u2019t quite as attractive for investment bankers. These professionals work in a faster-paced environment and often work upwards of 80 hours per week. If you want to advance in the industry, you\u2019ll have to accept those long hours.</p>\n<p>A final difference between the two to consider is the work environment. Wealth managers often work for large firms and may work somewhat collaboratively with colleagues. However, the job primarily involves working with individuals to manage their finances.</p>\n<p>When it comes to investment banking, you aren\u2019t working with individuals. Instead, you work directly with corporations and government entities looking to raise capital. Investment banking is also a collaborative effort. Investment bankers don\u2019t generally work alone with their clients. Instead, they work on teams that often involve not only investment bankers, attorneys, and other professionals from their own firm, but from other firms as well.</p>\n<h2>Which One is Right For You?</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re considering a career in financial services, wealth management and investment banking are two excellent options. Both require similar levels of skill and education and offer similar earning potential.</p>\n<p>When deciding between these two careers, the most important things to consider are your desired work environment and work hours. If you want more work-life balance and the opportunity to work with individual clients, wealth management is probably right for you. On the other hand, if you want a fast-paced work environment where you work potentially long hours, consider a career in investment banking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">Author is not a client of Personal Capital Advisors Corporation and is compensated as a freelance writer.</p>\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">The content contained in this blog post is intended for general informational purposes only and is not meant to constitute legal, tax, accounting or investment advice.

            "content": "Key Findings\n\nA vast majority of U.S. consumers* are concerned about rising inflation (85%) and a recession (74%), and over half (56%) say their standard of living is declining.\nThere is a significant uptick in the percentage who feel \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d financially, especially among women (26%) and those who have changed jobs in the last year (27%).\n69% think their income isn\u2019t keeping up with inflation, but less than half (41%) are asking for a raise at work.\nThe average salary needed to feel financially healthy dropped 13% in the past six months to $107.8K, though expectations remain higher among men ($129.5K) and Millennials ($133.8K). Conversely, the average savings needed to feel financially healthy spiked 17%.\n79% of cryptocurrency owners are concerned about market volatility.\n\n\n\u00a0\nU.S. consumers are feeling the squeeze of record-setting inflation, market volatility and a looming recession \u2013 and it\u2019s taking a toll. Over half (56%) of Americans say their standard of living is declining, and nearly 4 in 10 (38%) are feeling financially unhealthy, according to a Personal Capital and Empower survey* fielded by The Harris Poll.\nWith a vast majority concerned about rising inflation (85%) and a potential recession (74%) knocking their financial stability, here\u2019s how today\u2019s worries are showing up in consumers\u2019 spending, saving and investing habits.\nBracing for the storm: as worry increases, 73% of people are taking financial actions to prepare.\nPeople are battening down the hatches to prepare for a recession.\n\nTo hedge against inflation, nearly half of people say they\u2019ll change their investment approach (49%) and will contribute more to retirement savings (54%).\nSome 71% say they\u2019re cutting back on daily expenses, reining in spending on entertainment (41%), dining out (40%), and travel (40%). But, not so fast when it comes to their favorite things: 33% of people say they \u201cwon\u2019t be switching to cheaper brands than I normally buy.\u201d\nNotably, women are more likely than men to say they\u2019re cutting back across all top spending categories.\n\nWorried about inflation eating into your savings? Use our Retirement Planner to model different scenarios based on inflation.\nEconomy, on the rocks. Consumer spending is focused on experiences \u2013 those we can live with, and can\u2019t live without.\n\nDespite their worries, many are living it up when it comes to travel \u2013 especially Millennials (aged 26-41). They\u2019re also the generation least likely to cut back on travel in light of inflation (35% versus 40% general population).\nIn May, the average Personal Capital user spent** $1,304 on travel. That\u2019s 227% more than the pandemic low of April 2020 at $399 and 28% more than pre-pandemic levels of $1,017 in February 2020.\nThough survey respondents say they plan to cut costs, anonymized Personal Capital spending data** shows consumers are still putting increasingly more money into entertainment, food, travel and gas expenses.\n\nCryptocurrency remains a gamble \u2013 some have FOMO, while others say \u2018no go.\u2019\n\nAs many investors grapple with how \u2013 or whether \u2013 to incorporate crypto assets, Millennials (50%) and GenZ (49%) are disproportionately worried about its impact on their financial health, compared to the general population (33%).\nCrypto\u2019s a big conversation right now. If you\u2019re interested in adding crypto to your portfolio, the place to start is by assessing your diversification and risk tolerance.\n\u201cWe do not believe most investors need to concern themselves with adding crypto to their portfolios, if not inclined to do so,\u201d says Lacey Cobb, CFA, CFP\u00ae and Director of Advice Solutions at Personal Capital. \u201cCrypto assets require a high risk tolerance \u2013 these are highly volatile investments with unknown return assumptions that add risk to a portfolio. As with other speculative investments, limit your positions to an amount you can afford to lose.\u201d\nGreat reset\u2026or regret? Financial confidence wavers at work.\n\nAn uneasy financial climate has dulled people\u2019s salary expectations; the average salary needed to feel financially healthy dropped 13% from six months ago to $107.8K. However, the ideal income still remains higher among men ($129.5K) than women ($83.9K). Millennials and Gen Z have higher-than-average salary expectations ($133.7K and $171.6K, respectively).\n\u201cYeah, making more money is great, but it\u2019s what you do with your earnings that makes the real difference,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cRegardless of the number on your paycheck, avoiding high-interest debt and saving a meaningful percentage of your income can put you in a better spot in the long run.\u201d\nIn terms of stowing away earnings, respondents say they need to have saved $529.9K to feel financially healthy. Again, savings expectations are higher for men ($584.6K) than women ($468.7K). Men are also contributing more frequently (82%) than women (63%) to employer-sponsored retirement accounts.\nGot advice? Nearly half (46%) of Americans confess they don\u2019t know how to invest.\n\nSo what are some strategies?\n\u201cDon\u2019t sell your investments in a panic,\u201d says Craig Birk, Chief Investment Officer at Personal Capital. \u201cStocks can be a secret weapon because they offer you one of the best chances to mitigate the impact of inflation and, in the long run, you\u2019re well-positioned to beat it several times over.\u201d\nOver the past 30 years, the average annual inflation rate has sat around 2.31%. (Current U.S. inflation is at 8.6%.) But the average historical return of the stock market over time is about 10%.\n\u201cIn a choppy market, there are plenty of opportunities to take control of your money. Knowing your net worth puts you in the driver\u2019s seat because you need a real-time measure of your financial health to make smart moves,\u201d Birk says.\nAs always, the fundamentals hold true, according to Cobb. \u201cTake a critical look at your financial situation. Pay down consumer debt. Build emergency savings. Identify your discretionary spending. And don\u2019t lose sight of your long-term goals; keep contributing to your retirement accounts, especially if you get a 401k match from your employer.\u201d\nFor press inquiries and interviews, please contact Alicia Castro, Senior Manager of Content & Communications, at alicia.castro@personalcapital.com.\n*Methodology: This survey was conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of Empower Retirement and Personal Capital from April 19 to April 23, 2022.

However, the ideal income still remains higher among men ($129.5K) than women ($83.9K). Millennials and Gen Z have higher-than-average salary expectations ($133.7K and $171.6K, respectively).</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, making more money is great, but it\u2019s what you do with your earnings that makes the real difference,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cRegardless of the number on your paycheck, avoiding high-interest debt and saving a meaningful percentage of your income can put you in a better spot in the long run.\u201d</p>\n<p>In terms of stowing away earnings, respondents say they need to have saved $529.9K to feel financially healthy.

(Current U.S. inflation is at <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm\">8.6%</a>.)

Knowing your net worth puts you in the driver\u2019s seat because you need a real-time measure of your financial health to make smart moves,\u201d Birk says.</p>\n<p>As always, the fundamentals hold true, according to Cobb. \u201cTake a critical look at your financial situation. Pay down consumer debt. Build emergency savings. Identify your discretionary spending. And don\u2019t lose sight of your long-term goals; keep contributing to your retirement accounts, especially if you get a 401k match from your employer.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"disclaimer\">For press inquiries and interviews, please contact Alicia Castro, Senior Manager of Content & Communications, at <a href=\"mailto:alicia.castro@personalcapital.com\">alicia.castro@personalcapital.com</a>.</div>\n<div class=\"disclaimer\">*Methodology: This survey was conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of Empower Retirement and Personal Capital from April 19 to April 23, 2022.

Getting clarity on your net worth is an important step toward financial wellbeing.\nRetirement investing plays a critical role in many millionaires\u2019 portfolios. Of high-net-worth individuals who use the Personal Capital dashboard, retirement accounts \u2013 like 401k plans and IRAs \u2013 contribute 55% of their overall wealth.\nTracking your net worth over time can be a valuable indicator of your financial health. Yet only 35% of U.S. adults are confident they understand what \u201cnet worth\u201d means, even though most (91%) have heard of it.\nMichelle Brownstein, a certified financial planner who works with high-net-worth clients, comments on the importance of net worth and advises how to build wealth over time.\n\n\nTop Google searches around the concept of \u201cnet worth\u201d read like a lineup of the rich(est) and famous: Jeff Bezos net worth. Elon Musk net worth. Kanye West net worth.\nMost U.S. adults (91%) have heard of \u201cnet worth,\u201d but only 35% are confident that they know what it means, according to a recent Morning Consult survey* of 2,200 adults commissioned by Personal Capital.\nBut why does \u201cnet worth\u201d even matter?\nEveryone has a net worth. And knowing yours can help you manage your money better, according to Michelle Brownstein, a certified financial planner and vice president of Personal Capital Private Client Group.\n\u201cYour net worth is a bird\u2019s eye view of your complete financial situation,\u201d she says. \u201cTracking it over time is a valuable indicator of your financial stability.\u201d\nWhat Is \u2018Net Worth\u2019?\nYour net worth is what you own minus what you owe. You can calculate yours by adding up your assets and then subtracting your liabilities. Brownstein recommends Personal Capital\u2019s free net worth calculator, which aggregates a person\u2019s financial accounts for real-time net worth tracking. Personal Capital\u2019s free tools enable 3.3 million U.S. households to plan for long-term goals like retirement.\nAlthough the concept of \u201cnet worth\u201d may sound straightforward, there\u2019s often disagreement about exactly what should be included in a net worth calculation.\nAssets & Liabilities\nFor instance, only 35% of the U.S. adults we surveyed feel a mortgage should be factored into a person\u2019s net worth, even though 59% agree they\u2019d include home equity.\nChecking and savings accounts, property values, financial investments and retirement funds are the only factors that the majority of U.S. adults would include in a net worth calculation. All of these are assets.\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that most people include their cash in net worth, but far fewer consider their debt,\u201d Brownstein says. \u201cThis is simply incorrect as net worth by definition is total assets netted out against debt. Knowing where you stand can allow you to create a plan for debt management.\u201d\nRead More: What is Debt Management?\nGet your true net worth with Personal Capital\u2019s free net worth calculator. The tools also project future net-worth estimates, allowing you to plan for long-term goals like retirement.\nWhat\u2019s the Average Net Worth?\nMost (74%) people believe the average net worth of a U.S. adult is less than $100,000. A third of respondents (33%) think the average net worth sits between $10,000 and $29,999.\nPeople\u2019s net worth often varies by age, first as they increase their income and diversify their assets, and then withdrawal from earnings in retirement.\nThis is evidenced by the net worths by age of people who use the Personal Capital Dashboard. If the averages seem high, it\u2019s because affluent households drive the figure up. The median net worth may provide a better idea for benchmarking.\n\n\n\nAge By Decade\nAverage Net Worth\nMedian Net Worth\n\n\n20s\n$88,949\n$7,987\n\n\n30s\n$290,498\n$48,985\n\n\n40s\n$756,000\n$170,767\n\n\n50s\n$1,334,826\n$360,803\n\n\n60s\n$1,726,840\n$549,872\n\n\n70s\n$1,654,164\n$478,171\n\n\n80s\n$1,555,550\n$426,042\n\n\n90s\n$1,397,572\n$380,227\n\n\nNo Age Provided\n$217,220\n$2,559\n\n\nAll Ages\n$564,888\n$46,573\n\n\n\nWhat Is Considered High Net Worth?\nA person with a high net worth is known as a HNWI (\u201chigh net worth individual\u201d). U.S. adults we surveyed gave a wide range of responses for what they\u2019d consider a HNWI; the median average landed at $400,000.\nThis figure is much lower than the broadly accepted definition of a HNWI: someone with at least $1 million in liquid assets.\nIn spite of these discrepancies, the vast majority of adults we surveyed (74%) still don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly likely that they\u2019ll ever become a HNWI themselves. Only 3% say they already are.\nHowever, knowing your net worth is an important starting point, according to Brownstein.\n\u201cIn many cases, you don\u2019t need to be a HNW investor to achieve your goals and long-term retirement needs,\u201d Brownstein says. \u201cThe key is to make a plan and have a goal you\u2019re working toward. Most likely, this does entail setting a net worth goal that will allow you to sustain your lifestyle when you retire.\u201d\nWhat Makes a HNWI?\nHere are the top six factors U.S. adults think are important to achieving a \u201chigh\u201d net worth:\n\nFrequently checking in on and tracking their finances (65%)\nHaving a high salary (64%)\nHaving high earning potential from multiple sources (63%)\nMaintaining a diversified investment portfolio (59%)\nBeing very frugal with spending (57%)\nInvesting in property (55%)\n\nInterestingly, nearly 3 in 10 (29%) think that getting help from family or receiving an inheritance is also important to achieving high net worth.\nHigh Earning Potential\nThose we surveyed place a high value on earned income. In order to achieve a high net worth, respondents say a person needs to earn $100,000 a year.\nIncome can certainly help, but it\u2019s not everything.\n\u201cMaking money is only part of how a person builds wealth,\u201d says Brownstein, who works with high-net-worth clients with at least $1 million (and up to $30+ million) in their portfolios. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to make sure your money is working as hard for you as you work to earn it.\u201d\nDiversified Investing for the Long Haul\nBrownstein says that today\u2019s affluent have learned to make money \u201cwork\u201d by earning interest, dividends, and returns.\nAlthough most survey respondents (59%) agree that it\u2019s important to maintain a diversified investment portfolio, fewer (46%) prioritize maxing out retirement accounts.\nThis may be to their detriment. Personal Capital data indicates that retirement accounts \u2013 like 401k and IRAs \u2013 contribute nearly 55% of the wealth of high-net-worth individuals.\n\n\n\nRetirement Accounts of High-Net-Worth Individuals\n\n\n\n\nAge (By Decade)\nMedian Retirement Balance\nMedian Net Worth\nPercent of Net Worth in Retirement Accounts\n\n\n20s\n$319,348\n$1,469,913\n21.73%\n\n\n30s\n$589,643\n$1,552,772\n37.97%\n\n\n40s\n$951,160\n$1,746,364\n54.47%\n\n\n50s\n$1,195,801\n$1,919,500\n62.30%\n\n\n60s\n$1,250,692\n$1,992,485\n62.77%\n\n\n70s\n$1,092,814\n$1,953,502\n55.94%\n\n\n80s\n$788,359\n$1,905,679\n41.37%\n\n\n90s\n$419,950\n$1,978,622\n21.22%\n\n\nNo Age Provided\n$752,403\n$1,656,301\n45.43%\n\n\nAll Ages\n$970,094\n$1,781,923\n54.44%\n\n\n\nAnonymized data of accounts $1-5M net worth as of April 1, 2022\n\u00a0\n\u201cTax-advantaged retirement accounts are powerful investing tools,\u201d Brownstein says. \u201cIf a 401k employer match is available to you, try to at least contribute enough to take advantage of it. As your income increases, be sure to increase contributions to your retirement and brokerage accounts \u2013 don\u2019t let cash sit idle.\u201d\nRelated Articles on Building a High Net Worth\n6 Ways to Mimic Financial Practices of High-Net-Worth Individuals\nHow Much Cash is Enough?

A third of respondents (33%) think the average net worth sits between $10,000 and $29,999.</p>\n<p>People\u2019s net worth often varies by age, first as they increase their income and diversify their assets, and then withdrawal from earnings in retirement.</p>\n<p>This is evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/average-net-worth-by-age/\">net worths by age</a> of people who use the Personal Capital Dashboard.

U.S. adults we surveyed gave a wide range of responses for what they\u2019d consider a HNWI; the median average landed at $400,000.</p>\n<p>This figure is much lower than the broadly accepted definition of a <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-finance/high-net-worth-individual/\">HNWI</a>: someone with at least $1 million in liquid assets.</p>\n<p>In spite of these discrepancies, the vast majority of adults we surveyed (74%) still don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly likely that they\u2019ll ever become a HNWI themselves. Only 3% say they already are.</p>\n<p>However, knowing your net worth is an important starting point, according to Brownstein.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn many cases, you don\u2019t need to be a HNW investor to achieve your goals and long-term retirement needs,\u201d Brownstein says. \u201cThe key is to make a plan and have a goal you\u2019re working toward. Most likely, this does entail setting a net worth goal that will allow you to sustain your lifestyle when you retire.\u201d</p>\n<h2>What Makes a HNWI?</h2>\n<p>Here are the top six factors U.S. adults think are important to achieving a \u201chigh\u201d net worth:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Frequently checking in on and tracking their finances (65%)</li>\n<li>Having a high salary (64%)</li>\n<li>Having high earning potential from multiple sources (63%)</li>\n<li>Maintaining a diversified investment portfolio (59%)</li>\n<li>Being very frugal with spending (57%)</li>\n<li>Investing in property (55%)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Interestingly, nearly 3 in 10 (29%) think that getting help from family or receiving an inheritance is also important to achieving high net worth.</p>\n<h3><strong>High Earning Potential</strong></h3>\n<p>Those we surveyed place a high value on earned income. In order to achieve a high net worth, respondents say a person needs to earn $100,000 a year.</p>\n<p>Income can certainly help, but it\u2019s not everything.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaking money is only part of how a person builds wealth,\u201d says Brownstein, who works with high-net-worth clients with at least $1 million (and up to $30+ million) in their portfolios. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to make sure your money is working as hard for you as you work to earn it.\u201d</p>\n<h3><strong>Diversified Investing for the Long Haul</strong></h3>\n<p>Brownstein says that today\u2019s affluent have learned to<strong> make money \u201cwork\u201d by earning interest, dividends, and returns</strong>.</p>\n<p>Although most survey respondents (59%) agree that it\u2019s important to maintain a <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/guide-portfolio-diversification/\">diversified investment portfolio</a>, fewer (46%) prioritize maxing out retirement accounts.</p>\n<p>This may be to their detriment.

But according to key indicators of financial health, 30% are actually thriving.\nWomen we surveyed report feeling less confident than men across all key factors of financial health. Only 36% of women (versus 47% of men) agree that they are confident in their financial plan.\nWhen it comes to retirement savings, women report needing significantly less ($496,631) than men ($822,064), even though women on average live longer.\nLacey Cobb, CFA, CFP\u00ae, Personal Capital Director of Advice Solutions, weighs in on best practices for managing your money and building wealth.\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with the good news: You may be more financially healthy than you think.\nAmericans we surveyed for our recent Wealth & Wellness Index* consistently rate themselves as less financially stable than they actually are.\nWomen in particular understate their financial health. Below, the \u201cSelf-Rated\u201d columns indicate how respondents say they\u2019re doing with their money \u2013 just surviving, feeling stable, or thriving.

Herein lies the bad news. These individuals report:\n\nA lagging sense of financial confidence\nLower income and savings expectations than men\nReduced prioritization of long-term financial goals\n\n\u201cA solid financial plan is important for anyone,\u201d says Lacey Cobb, Personal Capital Director of Advice Solutions and certified financial planner. \u201cThis may be even more true for women given their longer life expectancies and other unfortunate societal factors like lower rates of investing and lower expected income.\u201d\nAt a macro level, women are in a strong financial position. Women in the U.S. control $22 trillion \u2013 over half of the country\u2019s wealth. What\u2019s more, by 2030, it\u2019s estimated that women will control two-thirds of the nation\u2019s wealth, due to organic growth and intergenerational and spousal transfer.\n\u201cFor anyone wanting to improve their financial health, I\u2019d suggest taking matters into their own hands,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cLearn. Utilize free resources. Consider working with a fiduciary advisor you trust. A sense of financial confidence comes from taking action.\u201d\nTake the free Wealth & Wellness Quiz to see where you stand.\n\nFinancial Confidence \u2013 It\u2019s More Than Just a Feeling\nNotably, 56% of the women we surveyed report an increased sense of financial confidence over the past year. However, that gain is to a lesser extent than the men we surveyed (68%). Additionally, women report less confidence than men across all key factors of financial health.\nTroublingly, this is most true among Gen X women, who are in their peak earning years and overall as a generation saw the biggest increase in wealth since the pandemic began.\n\n\n\nRate your confidence in the following areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nMen Overall\nWomen Overall\nGen Z Women\nMillennial Women\nGen X Women\nBoomer Women\n\n\nAbility to build emergency savings\n75%\n64%\n69%\n65%\n58%\n64%\n\n\nAbility to achieve saving goals I\u2019ve set for myself\n77%\n63%\n60%\n67%\n54%\n64%\n\n\nAbility to plan for retirement\n74%\n62%\n54%\n59%\n58%\n65%\n\n\nAbility to retire when I want\n67%\n57%\n54%\n50%\n43%\n67%\n\n\nAbility to leverage my financial assets to maximize my overall wealth\n70%\n55%\n52%\n56%\n47%\n55%\n\n\nAbility to minimize my taxes\n68%\n52%\n50%\n50%\n45%\n55%\n\n\nState of the economy overall\n51%\n40%\n43%\n44%\n38%\n35%\n\n\nJob security overall\n77%\n70%\n71%\n76%\n74%\n64%\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMoreover, across the spectrum of emotions, men are more likely than women to associate positive feelings with their finances. Women are more likely to report feeling stressed and unsatisfied.\nOf note, both genders most heartily agree that they feel optimistic and hopeful, though women feel this to a lesser extent.\n\n\n\nWhen you think about your financial health journey, what do you feel?\nMen\nWomen\n\n\nProud\n22%\n16%\n\n\nEncouraged\n26%\n20%\n\n\nStressed\n21%\n33%\n\n\nUnsatisfied\n13%\n17%\n\n\nDirectionless\n8%\n8%\n\n\nOptimistic\n46%\n33%\n\n\nHopeful\n42%\n39%\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cMoney tends to be emotional for people,\u201d says Cobb, \u201cand like anything else, the best way to manage emotions is to focus on what you can control. When it comes to finances, you have at least some control over how you spend, save, and invest. So this should be the focus.\u201d\nCobb says getting clarity on your money and creating a plan can help harness a sense of financial confidence.\nGet a complete view of your money with Personal Capital\u2019s free financial dashboard. You\u2019ll see your net worth, cash flow, investment allocation, and more. You can also plan for long-term goals like funding higher education or retiring.\nHow to Gain Financial Confidence\nIn terms of learning about personal finance, 61% of surveyed women versus 71% of men say that they actively read and seek new information. Millennial women (73%) were the only age group to outrank men in saying they\u2019re studying up on financial topics.\nFollowing are Cobb\u2019s insights on a few key areas that help determine financial health: income, debt management, emergency savings, and retirement planning.\n1. Consider your income.\nIncome is important; a steady paycheck enables you to consistently afford everyday needs, budget for upcoming expenses, and, ideally, invest in long-term goals.\nWomen (46%) are more likely than men (42%) to say their salary is a top factor in determining their financial health. However, 33% of women (and just 27% of men) say their income is their biggest roadblock to becoming financially healthy.\nThe gender wage gap persists: Women earn 82 cents for every dollar a man earns, according to 2020 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over recent decades, the gap has narrowed among younger women as they break into higher-paying occupations traditionally dominated by men. (However, among individuals with college degrees, the gender earnings gap is even wider.)\nIn our recent survey, women report a lower \u201cdesired salary\u201d than their male counterparts. Women say they need to earn $101,153 annually to feel financially healthy. Men say they need $142,388. Over the course of a 30-year career, that higher salary would give someone a $1.2M advantage. (Of note, this is not accounting for raises, which men receive more frequently.)\n\u201cIn your career, it\u2019s essential to advocate for yourself \u2013 get the market rate for the work you provide,\u201d Cobb says.\u00a0 \u201cAnd then remember: How much money you earn is only part of the overall picture. Equally important is what you do with your earnings.\u201d\nKeep Learning: How to Negotiate Your Salary and Career Advancement\n2. Pay attention to debt management.\nFor many people, paying off debt is a long-term challenge.\nWomen, more than men, are prioritizing debt paydown, with 39% of surveyed women versus 34% of men saying it\u2019s their top goal for 2022.\nAnd the focus is with good reason: Women we surveyed (45%) are less likely than men (56%) to say that their debt is manageable.\nRead More: What is Debt Management?\nFor respondents paying off debt, debt type varied by gender. More men than women are chipping away at student loans, mortgages, and medical bills; women said they\u2019re most inclined to be tackling personal debt.\n\n\n\nWhat type of debt will you plan to pay off?\nMen\nWomen\n\n\nStudent loans\n25%\n20%\n\n\nPaying off a mortgage\n40%\n28%\n\n\nPaying off medical bills\n27%\n23%\n\n\nOther personal debt\n58%\n75%\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMore than half of Americans carry a credit card balance, according to one 2021 study. Data from the credit bureau Experian indicates that the average card balance is more than $5,500.\n\u201cPersonal debt is extremely common,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to feel ashamed about. But due to high interest rates, you may start to feel like you\u2019re constantly throwing money at your debt. That can definitely bring stress into your life.\u201d\nIn paying off debt, Cobb says it\u2019s important to prioritize high-interest debt, and then move on to debts that aren\u2019t accruing as much interest. Debt consolidation services may also be an option.\n\u201cNot all debt is bad,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe most important aspect of managing debt is consistently making payments. Carrying \u2018good debt,\u2019 like a mortgage, signals to creditors that you\u2019re a responsible credit user.\u201d\nThis strengthens your credit score and may allow you increased credit lines to finance future purchases, like a rental property.\n3. Maintain an emergency fund.\nYour first line of defense against debt is a cash emergency fund. For women we surveyed, building an emergency fund is among their top financial goals in 2022: 38% of women versus just 25% of men say it\u2019s a priority this year.\n\u201cThis goal deserves to be celebrated,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cAn emergency fund serves as a bedrock of financial health.\u201d\nOf the Americans we surveyed, women place a higher priority than men on the importance of being able to withstand unexpected financial needs, with 45% of women versus 38% of men saying it\u2019s a top factor in determining their financial health.\nYet only 47% of women (versus 58% of men) say they could handle a major unforeseen expense ($500 or more) without worrying too much about it.\nHow Much to Save\nExactly how much you need to have stashed away depends on your expenses and household income. Cobb advises keeping between three to six months worth of basic expenses in an easily accessible savings account. If you\u2019re part of a two-earner household, you may feel comfortable with less.\nAn emergency fund can be difficult to start without high income or financial windfall. Cobb suggests starting with an attainable goal, like setting aside $500 in two months. Once you meet that target, bump the goal up again.\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel discouraged if you have to start small,\u201d she says. \u201cRemember that having some money to fall back on in a time of crisis is better than having nothing.\u201d\n4. Invest in retirement planning.\nSaving for retirement is possibly a person\u2019s largest expense throughout their life. However, many adults nearing retirement age may not be prepared to retire: 60% of men told us they have some form of retirement savings; the same is true for only 53% of women.\n\u201cIt can be challenging to save for long-term goals, particularly with rising expenses and many current competing priorities,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cTry to consider it a payment to your future self.\u201d\nIn that, take into consideration how much you may need. Our survey revealed that women believe they need significantly less than men in retirement savings, even though women on average live longer.\n\n\n\nHow much money do you need to have saved for retirement?\nMen\nWomen\n\n\n\n$822,064\n$496,631\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cRetirement planning is important \u2013 especially for women, due to longer life expectancies and, thus, potentially more healthcare expenses in those extended golden years,\u201d Cobb says.\nShe says that most people want a straightforward, dollar-figure-answer for how much they need to save. \u201cThe reality is it is not that simple,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cIt\u2019ll depend on your spending needs, future goals, where you live, and many other factors. The best way to get a grasp on this is to create a retirement plan using financial planning tools that can help calculate this figure for you.\u201d\nWant to see if you\u2019re on the right track? Use our free Retirement Planner to run different scenarios, anticipate big expenses, and get a spending plan for retirement.\nWhy to Invest\nThe sooner you start investing money for retirement, the greater your opportunity to take advantage of the power of compounding. With compounding returns, you earn money not only on the amount of your initial investment, but also on the money that your investment earns.\nHowever, amidst a period of volatility like our current market environment, investors tend to become wary of the stock market in general. This could be detrimental to building wealth over time.\n\u201cOnce again, try to focus on what you can control, like maintaining a balanced portfolio and consistently investing,\u201d Cobb suggests. \u201cIt would be a very poor investment strategy to react to the latest headlines by making decisions in your investment portfolio. Investors should focus on making sure they have a properly diversified portfolio with the appropriate amount of risk rather than trying to time when to buy into the stock market.\u201d\nHow to Invest\nAs much as is possible, Cobb recommends investing in your employer-provided 401k or other types of retirement accounts. \u201cTypically, the best approach is to automate these savings by participating in employer sponsored retirement plans or setting up recurring contributions into your investment accounts,\u201d Cobb suggests.\nLook into free resources to help you determine the best retirement plan for you:\n\nTypes of Retirement Plans for Individuals\nHow to Save for Retirement\nRetirement Savings Calculator: Are You Saving Enough to Retire Comfortably?\n\nHow Much to Invest\nHow much should you save for retirement? That depends on a variety of factors: retirement horizon, anticipated retirement income, overall health, and desired lifestyle.\nAs a starting point for figuring out how much you should be stowing away, Cobb suggests setting age-based retirement savings goals. Here are potential benchmarks:\n\nAge 30: Have saved an amount equal to your annual salary\nAge 40: Have saved an amount equal to three times your annual salary\nAge 50: Have saved an amount equal to six times your annual salary\nAge 60: Have saved an amount equal to eight times your annual salary\nAge 67: Have saved an amount equal to 10 times your annual salary\n\n\u201cRetirement planning \u2013 like personal finance overall \u2013 is personal to you and your goals,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cHaving a plan in place can help give you peace of mind and free up energy to focus on the areas of your life that truly matter to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nFor press inquiries and interviews, please contact Jacqueline Quasney, Personal Capital Director of PR, at press@personalcapital.com.\n* Survey Methodology: This survey was conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of Empower and Personal Capital from October 29 to November 3, 2021.

Millennial women (73%) were the only age group to outrank men in saying they\u2019re studying up on financial topics.</p>\n<p>Following are Cobb\u2019s insights on a few key areas that help determine financial health: income, debt management, emergency savings, and retirement planning.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Consider your income.</strong></h3>\n<p>Income is important; a steady paycheck enables you to consistently afford everyday needs, budget for upcoming expenses, and, ideally, invest in long-term goals.</p>\n<p>Women (46%) are more likely than men (42%) to say their salary is a top factor in determining their financial health. However, 33% of women (and just 27% of men) say their income is their biggest roadblock to becoming financially healthy.</p>\n<p>The gender wage gap persists: Women earn 82 cents for every dollar a man earns, according to <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/01/gender-pay-gap-widens-as-women-age.html\">2020 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. Over recent decades, the gap has narrowed among <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/25/gender-pay-gap-facts/\">younger women</a> as they break into higher-paying occupations traditionally dominated by men. (However, among individuals with college degrees, the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/05/college-degree-widens-gender-earnings-gap.html\">gender earnings gap is even wider</a>.)</p>\n<p>In our recent survey, women report a lower \u201cdesired salary\u201d than their male counterparts. Women say they need to earn $101,153 annually to feel financially healthy. Men say they need $142,388. Over the course of a 30-year career, that higher salary would give someone a $1.2M advantage. (Of note, this is not accounting for raises, which men <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2019/06/10/men-and-women-ask-for-pay-raises-at-the-same-rate-but-men-get-them-more-often/\">receive more frequently</a>.)</p>\n<p>\u201cIn your career, it\u2019s essential to advocate for yourself \u2013 get the market rate for the work you provide,\u201d Cobb says.\u00a0 \u201cAnd then remember: How much money you earn is only part of the overall picture. Equally important is what you do with your earnings.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Keep Learning:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/family-life/negotiate-salary-career-advancement/\">How to Negotiate Your Salary and Career Advancement</a></p>\n<h3><strong>2. Pay attention to debt management.</strong></h3>\n<p>For many people, <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-finance/debt-payoff/\">paying off debt</a> is a long-term challenge.</p>\n<p>Women, more than men, are prioritizing debt paydown, with 39% of surveyed women versus 34% of men saying it\u2019s their top goal for 2022.</p>\n<p>And the focus is with good reason: Women we surveyed (45%) are less likely than men (56%) to say that their debt is manageable.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-finance/what-is-debt-management/\">What is Debt Management?</a></p>\n<p>For respondents paying off debt, debt type varied by gender. More men than women are chipping away at <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-finance/student-loan-payments-resume/\">student loans</a>, mortgages, and medical bills; women said they\u2019re most inclined to be tackling personal debt.</p>\n<table class=\"pc-table first-center second-center third-center fourth-center fifth-center highlight-odd\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>What type of debt will you plan to pay off?</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Men</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Women</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Student loans</td>\n<td>25%</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Paying off a mortgage</td>\n<td>40%</td>\n<td>28%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Paying off medical bills</td>\n<td>27%</td>\n<td>23%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other personal debt</td>\n<td>58%</td>\n<td>75%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>More than half of Americans carry a credit card balance, according to one <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/credit-card-debt-poll/\">2021 study</a>. <a href=\"https://www.experian.com/blogs/insights/2021/09/state-of-credit-2021/\">Data from the credit bureau Experian</a> indicates that the average card balance is more than $5,500.</p>\n<p>\u201cPersonal debt is extremely common,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to feel ashamed about. But due to high interest rates, you may start to feel like you\u2019re constantly throwing money at your debt. That can definitely bring stress into your life.\u201d</p>\n<p>In paying off debt, Cobb says it\u2019s important to prioritize high-interest debt, and then move on to debts that aren\u2019t accruing as much interest. Debt consolidation services may also be an option.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot all debt is bad,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe most important aspect of managing debt is <strong>consistently making payments</strong>. Carrying \u2018good debt,\u2019 like a mortgage, signals to creditors that you\u2019re a responsible credit user.\u201d</p>\n<p>This strengthens your credit score and may allow you increased credit lines to finance future purchases, like a <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing/buying-rental-property/\">rental property</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Maintain an emergency fund.</strong></h3>\n<p>Your first line of defense against debt is a cash <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/emergency-fund-how-much-should-i-save/\">emergency fund</a>. For women we surveyed, building an emergency fund is among their top financial goals in 2022: 38% of women versus just 25% of men say it\u2019s a priority this year.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis goal deserves to be celebrated,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cAn emergency fund serves as a bedrock of financial health.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of the Americans we surveyed, women place a higher priority than men on the importance of being able to withstand unexpected financial needs, with 45% of women versus 38% of men saying it\u2019s a top factor in determining their financial health.</p>\n<p>Yet only 47% of women (versus 58% of men) say they could handle a major unforeseen expense ($500 or more) without worrying too much about it.</p>\n<h4>How Much to Save</h4>\n<p>Exactly how much you need to have stashed away depends on your expenses and household income.

Invest in retirement planning.</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/best-ways-to-save-for-retirement/\">Saving for retirement</a> is possibly a person\u2019s largest expense throughout their life.

Investors should focus on making sure they have a <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/guide-portfolio-diversification/\">properly diversified portfolio</a> with the appropriate amount of risk rather than trying to time when to buy into the stock market.\u201d</p>\n<h4>How to Invest</h4>\n<p>As much as is possible, Cobb recommends investing in your employer-provided <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/401k-calculator-how-much-should-you-have-saved/\">401k</a> or other <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/types-of-retirement-plans/\">types of retirement accounts</a>. \u201cTypically, the best approach is to automate these savings by participating in employer sponsored retirement plans or setting up recurring contributions into your investment accounts,\u201d Cobb suggests.</p>\n<p>Look into free resources to help you determine the best retirement plan for you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/types-of-retirement-plans/\">Types of Retirement Plans for Individuals</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/best-ways-to-save-for-retirement/\">How to Save for Retirement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/retirement-savings-calculator/\">Retirement Savings Calculator: Are You Saving Enough to Retire Comfortably?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How Much to Invest</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/how-much-should-i-save-for-retirement/\">How much should you save for retirement</a>? That depends on a variety of factors: retirement horizon, anticipated retirement income, overall health, and desired lifestyle.</p>\n<p>As a starting point for figuring out how much you should be stowing away, Cobb suggests setting <strong>age-based retirement savings goals</strong>. Here are potential benchmarks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age 30:</strong> Have saved an amount equal to your annual salary</li>\n<li><strong>Age 40:</strong> Have saved an amount equal to three times your annual salary</li>\n<li><strong>Age 50: </strong>Have saved an amount equal to six times your annual salary</li>\n<li><strong>Age 60:</strong> Have saved an amount equal to eight times your annual salary</li>\n<li><strong>Age 67:</strong> Have saved an amount equal to 10 times your annual salary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u201cRetirement planning \u2013 like personal finance overall \u2013 is personal to you and your goals,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cHaving a plan in place can help give you peace of mind and free up energy to focus on the areas of your life that truly matter to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"disclaimer\">\n<p>For press inquiries and interviews, please contact Jacqueline Quasney, Personal Capital Director of PR, at <strong>press@personalcapital.com</strong>.</p>\n<p>* Survey Methodology: This survey was conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of Empower and Personal Capital from October 29 to November 3, 2021.

            "content": "Key Takeaways\n\n57% of surveyed U.S. adults say the pandemic has increased financial stress in their relationship.\nFinancial stress is most prevalent among younger generations; two in three (66%) partnered Millennials and Gen Zers say the pandemic has increased financial stress in their partnerships.\nBut many people steer clear of financial conversations; nearly 4 out of 10 (39%) adults avoid talking about money with a romantic partner.\nThis is most true among Millennials, with 44% of this generation agreeing with the statement, \u201cI usually avoid talking about money with a romantic partner.\u201d\nHonesty and equity are the most valued qualities in a romantic partner, as 58% say they would end the relationship if their partner was being dishonest about money/their spending, and 32% would call it quits if their partner never/rarely offers to pay for things.\nFor those who say debt is a deal-breaker (29%), having debt in the tens of thousands is considered by most to be too much debt.\n\n\nMillennials, we need to talk.\nA recent Personal Capital survey* fielded by Morning Consult found that nearly half of Millennials (44%) avoid discussing money with their romantic partners.\nOf note, this age group would likely benefit from an honest chat; 66% of partnered people aged 18-34 say the pandemic has increased financial stress in their partnerships.\n\u201cMoney overall is still a taboo conversation for many people,\u201d says Krista Aliga, CFP\u00ae, a financial advisor with Personal Capital. \u201cIf your finances are stressing you out, it\u2019s even more important to be having these conversations.\u201d\nAliga adds that people in the Millennial age group are likely experiencing major life transitions in the midst of the pandemic \u2013 getting married, buying a home, having kids \u2013 which could make tension more acute.\n\u201cTo help ease stress when you have joint finances, I\u2019d advise transparency,\u201d Aliga says. \u201cIt\u2019s natural to want to close yourself off, but being open and honest with your partner about your concerns and stresses will help you work through them.\u201d\nHow to Have the Money Talk\nTalking about finances will be different throughout your relationship. Your financial conversations will expand based on numerous factors \u2013 how long you\u2019ve been together, what your goals are, and how much you pay attention to your own personal finances.\nAs you and your partner begin talking more regularly about money, consider the following best practices.\n1. Leave judgement at the door.\nWhen talking about money, try to remain open-minded, particularly if you\u2019re unfamiliar with your partner\u2019s inherited money attitudes.\n\u201cEveryone has different biases with finances,\u201d Aliga says. \u201cKeep in mind that your partner likely had a different financial formation, which can impact how they feel about money.\u201d\nAccording to a 2020 Personal Capital survey, 76% of respondents said their parents influenced their current financial practices. How you\u2019re raised can certainly impact your mindset, but it doesn\u2019t need to determine your choices. To get an understanding of how your partner first related with money, ask open-ended questions:\n\nWhat\u2019s the first conversation you remember having about finances?\nHow did your parents talk about money in general?\nWhat was your parents\u2019 spending style?\nWhat are some of your earliest memories around credit cards and debt?\nHow did you learn about saving? What about investing?\n\nAs your partner shares this information, stay neutral and curious. Understanding where you each come from can help inform how you move forward together.\n2. Commit to frequently checking in.\nSetting a framework for when you\u2019ll talk about money can help ease stress, as you\u2019ll both know what to expect.\nOnce you\u2019re in a committed relationship, Aliga recommends starting off by touching base weekly on your cash flow and budget. As you continue talking through your finances together, your conversations can occur on a less frequent basis. Be sure to maintain consistency.\n\u201cOnce a month is appropriate for almost any couple to review the prior month and check in on upcoming goals,\u201d Aliga says.\n\n3. Keep it casual.\nTalking about money can get tense \u2013 especially if you or your partner has struggled with financial insecurity at some point in your life. As you set up regular check-ins, keep stress at bay by staying as relaxed as possible.\n\u201cGet coffee, go on a walk,\u201d Aliga says. \u201cTry getting out of the house and being in a casual environment; it\u2019ll help open up the conversation.\u201d\n4. Focus on goals.\nExpressing your goals will help you visualize what\u2019s important to each of you.\n\u201cGoals make conversations more meaningful,\u201d Aliga says. \u201cFor instance, if you set a goal attached to your budget, you\u2019ll be more driven to see it through. Otherwise, the ongoing conversations could feel like touching base without purpose.\u201d\nHere are a few topics to consider for your regular money dates:\n\nMonthly cash flow and budget goals (i.e. sticking to a 50-30-20 budget)\nShort-term goals (i.e., going on a vacation in a few months)\nMid-term goals (i.e., buying a new car or saving for a home down payment within the next few years)\nLong-term goals (i.e., career advancement, debt paydown, retirement planning)\n\nWhen you talk about each of these goals depends on your comfort level. Sharing long-term goals is likely the most challenging; 44% of adults we surveyed don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to talk about retirement plans until they\u2019re already married.\nHowever, Aliga cautions that may be too late. She says that it\u2019s best to talk about retirement plans before marriage to make sure you are both on the same page.\n\u201cWhat if one person wants to retire in their hometown and one wants to retire abroad? It\u2019s about sharing these goals together,\u201d she says. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean disclosing everything you have \u2013 it\u2019s more about getting a general sense of where you each see your lives 20-30 years from now. How do your long-term visions align?\u201d\nShe adds that you should both come to the understanding that your long-term goals may change. \u201cEven if it\u2019s not set in stone, it\u2019s a worthwhile ongoing conversation for committed couples,\u201d she says.\n5. Bring in backup.\nIf you\u2019re finding that talking about money is stressful, a financial advisor can be a good mediator.\n\u201cAn advisor can help guide and moderate some of those tougher questions, like how to pay off debt or achieve long-term goals,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving an advisor as part of the household team helps both partners feel equally looped into their financial situation.\u201d\nAlso, online financial tools can give you transparency in talking through your finances together. Aliga recommends Personal Capital\u2019s free money management tools.\nThe app can be part of your money dates: \u201cGetting that ongoing visibility can help prompt conversations around short-term budgeting goals and longer-term goals like retirement,\u201d she says.\nWhy Talking About Money Is Important\nIn the early stages of a relationship, being honest about your finances can help set a solid foundation. The most valued qualities in a romantic partner are honesty and equity, as 58% of our survey respondents say they\u2019d end the relationship if their partner was being dishonest about money/their spending, and 32% would call it quits if their partner never/rarely offers to pay for things.\n\nCheck, Please\nWhen you\u2019re dating someone new, the first money conversation you\u2019ll likely have is around who picks up the bill. And this is an important consideration for many people; 32% said it\u2019d be a deal breaker if their partner never/rarely offers to pay for things. This is most true among Baby Boomers (37%) and women (44%).\nAliga says honesty is the best policy.\n\u201cIn a healthy dating relationship, it all goes back to transparency,\u201d she says. \u201cIf your partner doesn\u2019t offer to pay and you aren\u2019t honest about how that makes you feel, the situation can really spiral into an additional stressor. Opening the conversation may reveal that your partner has financial stresses that you may not have been aware of.\u201d\nShe adds that the conversation doesn\u2019t need to be confrontational or intense. Instead, try proposing low-cost dates, or suggest trading off who plans and pays for dates.\nNo Debt About It\nDebt has become a normal part of Americans\u2019 financial lives; the average American now carries about $38,000 in personal debt, excluding home mortgages. According to the 2022 Wealth & Wellness Index, paying down personal debt is the top 2022 resolution for U.S. adults.\n\u201cDebt is certainly a contributing factor to stress in anyone\u2019s life \u2013 regardless of whether they\u2019re in a relationship or not,\u201d Aliga says.\nIf you\u2019re carrying debt, you\u2019d be wise to gauge your partner\u2019s comfort level; 29% of adults we surveyed said debt could be a deal breaker, especially if it\u2019s in the tens of thousands.\nEarly on in your relationship, be open about how you think about and manage debt, even if you don\u2019t get into specific numbers right away. Once you\u2019re in a committed relationship, shift the conversation to strategy.\n\u201cIf you are creating goals together, be as transparent as possible on what your goals are with that debt and how you plan to pay it down. Creating a plan depends on the type of debt, how much debt, and who\u2019s carrying the debt,\u201d Aliga says.\nRead More: 6 Steps to Take When You Marry Someone with 6 Figures of Debt\nAgain, Aliga emphasizes the value of honesty: \u201cThe more that couples can be transparent in these conversations, the more beneficial it will be to their relationship.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor press inquiries and interviews, please contact Jacqueline Quasney, Personal Capital Director of PR, at press@personalcapital.com.\n*Survey Methodology: This poll was conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of Personal Capital, between January 15-January 16, 2022 among a sample of 2,210 U.S. adults.

Opening the conversation may reveal that your partner has financial stresses that you may not have been aware of.\u201d</p>\n<p>She adds that the conversation doesn\u2019t need to be confrontational or intense. Instead, try proposing low-cost dates, or suggest trading off who plans and pays for dates.</p>\n<h3><strong>No Debt</strong> About<strong> It</strong></h3>\n<p>Debt has become a normal part of Americans\u2019 financial lives; the average American now <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/20/how-much-debt-americans-have-at-every-age.html\">carries about $38,000 in personal debt</a>, excluding home mortgages. According to the <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/2022-wealth-wellness-index/\">2022 Wealth & Wellness Index</a>, paying down personal debt is the top 2022 resolution for U.S. adults.</p>\n<p>\u201cDebt is certainly a contributing factor to stress in anyone\u2019s life \u2013 regardless of whether they\u2019re in a relationship or not,\u201d Aliga says.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re carrying debt, you\u2019d be wise to gauge your partner\u2019s comfort level; <strong>29% of adults we surveyed said debt could be a deal breaker</strong>, especially if it\u2019s in the tens of thousands.</p>\n<p>Early on in your relationship, be open about how you think about and <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-finance/what-is-debt-management/\">manage debt</a>, even if you don\u2019t get into specific numbers right away. Once you\u2019re in a committed relationship, shift the conversation to strategy.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you are creating goals together, be as transparent as possible on <strong>what your goals are with that debt</strong> and <strong>how you plan to pay it down</strong>. Creating a plan depends on the type of debt, how much debt, and who\u2019s carrying the debt,\u201d Aliga says.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/family-life/marriage-and-debt/\">6 Steps to Take When You Marry Someone with 6 Figures of Debt</a></p>\n<p>Again, Aliga emphasizes the value of honesty: \u201cThe more that couples can be transparent in these conversations, the more beneficial it will be to their relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"disclaimer\">For press inquiries and interviews, please contact Jacqueline Quasney, Personal Capital Director of PR, at press@personalcapital.com.<br />\n<strong><em>*Survey Methodology:</em></strong> This poll was conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of Personal Capital, between January 15-January 16, 2022 among a sample of 2,210 U.S. adults.

            "content": "I hate to be the one to remind you of this, but there\u2019s not much time before 2022 is at our metaphorical doorstep. It\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019re already two years into a decade that seems to have packed a lifetime\u2019s worth of events into 24 months.\nIf you\u2019re a small business owner, the end of the year is only the beginning of the busiest administrative season. From prepping taxes to finishing out projects, there\u2019s so much to do as the last sliver of 2021 slips away.\nTo (hopefully) help you rock your EOY goals and create a plan for 2022, I\u2019m going through my end-of-year small business checklist and walking you through how I prep for the new year.\nAll things taxes\nYou knew I had to start here. If I surveyed every business owner I know, I\u2019d guess that overwhelmingly they\u2019d all say doing taxes is their least favorite part of owning a business. Between making sure you\u2019re paying quarterly, deducting the right things, and putting aside enough \u2013\u2013 taxes are both daunting and anxiety-inducing. Here are some things to keep in mind.\n\n\nIf you can, hire an accountant to help you with your taxes\n\n\nNot everyone can afford to hire someone to do their books throughout the year, but you\u2019d be surprised at how affordable hiring an accountant is at tax time. Especially when dealing with 1099 or other self-employment income, working with a professional can save you money and keep you in the IRS\u2019s good graces. Tax software might save you a little upfront, but you may not be getting all the deductions you deserve.\n\n\nMake sure your books are clean and in order\n\n\nIt\u2019s a total pain, but going through your books at the end of the year is a necessity. Make sure that you have receipts for your purchases and have correctly categorized each one. It\u2019s time-consuming, so make it fun and put on your favorite sitcom reruns, grab a glass of your preferred beverage, and go through your statements with a fine-toothed comb.\n\n\nMake a plan for next year\n\n\nIs your tax prep really wearing you out? Right now is a great time to evaluate how you handled your bookkeeping throughout the year and make updates as needed. Did you wait until the last minute to categorize your expenses? Forget to update your bookkeeping software often enough? Make the adjustments that January 2023 you will thank you for.\n\n\nAutomate whatever you can for next year\n\n\nWhen you have traditional or W2 income, you have the benefit of your taxes coming out before you ever see them \u2013\u2013 which can make you complacent when it comes to putting taxes aside for your self-employment income. Circumvent the tax bill panic by setting up an automatic savings process from your business account to an HYSA (high-yield savings account). You\u2019re less likely to spend it or forget about it, and it will make your life a lot less stressful when it\u2019s time to pay the bill in April.\nThe season of giving\nThe end of the year is a great time to give, both because it\u2019s the holidays and you\u2019re running out of time to take advantage of the write-off for the year at hand. You\u2019re also probably looking at your final profits for the year and have a better idea of how much extra you can donate. Many non-profit organizations wait patiently for this time of year as December is one of the most significant fundraising months across the board.\nPersonally, I think it\u2019s important to give all year round, and many of these organizations prefer recurring donations on a schedule to help them plan their budgets for the year. Alongside giving an extra donation, check your YTD donations and see if you can set a plan to donate on a more regular schedule the following year to some of your favorite charities!\nThis is also a great time to consider giving holiday bonuses\u2019 or gifts to employees or clients. Showing appreciation to the people who keep your business running and the clients you love working with can go a long way if you have the means to.\nAs a bonus, it feels really good to give, too.\nP.S. It\u2019s better to do this sooner rather than waiting until the last day of the year. I can\u2019t tell you how many friends made big donations to a charity and because the gift didn\u2019t process until the new year, they lost out on the write-off. Fortunately, you can write it off the following year, but it\u2019s good to keep this in mind!\nBig purchases\nSpeaking of write-offs, the end of the year is also a great time to make any big last-minute purchases. If your 10-year-old laptop has been sputtering or you\u2019ve been working with a decades-old piece of machinery, the end of the year is a great time to make sure you\u2019re getting that write-off and keeping your business running efficiently.\nAs always, make sure you\u2019ll have money for your tax bill, employee bonuses, and other holiday expenditures first, but if there was a purchase you kept putting off and know you need \u2013\u2013 this is an excellent time to make it.\nMoney Date 2.0: Small Business Edition\nIf you\u2019ve read any of my other articles, you might be sick of the word \u201cMoney Date,\u201d but too bad \u2013\u2013 I\u2019m just going to keep talking about it. My Money Date methodology has been my biggest lifesaver and one of the best free tools I have to keep up with my finances.\nOn an individual Money Date, you\u2019re sitting down with a month\u2019s worth of statements and account balances to look for fraudulent charges, over and under-budgeted areas, subscriptions you no longer need, etc. The idea behind the Money Date is to make sure you\u2019re on top of every part of your finances.\nFor small business owners, it\u2019s the same process, just with more facets. If you\u2019re a small business owner going over your numbers on a money date, start asking questions like this:\n\nWhere in my business am I overspending?\nWhere am I underspending when I could afford more?\nAm I saving enough in taxes each quarter?\nIs my payroll keeping up with living wages?\nDo I need to hire a new team member?\nDo I need to scale back in an area so I can scale up in another?\n\nThis is just a small sample of the questions you might be asking yourself when you\u2019re on your small business Money Date.\nSetting Goals\nNow that you\u2019ve got taxes and all that administrative headaches covered, it\u2019s time to start dreaming big. I personally believe in setting audacious goals (shoot for the moon, land amongst the stars, you know?).\nNot every goal has to be a financial one, either. One of my goals this year was to make it into the top 20 business podcasts. We hit number one within two weeks. It had nothing to do with finances and all to do with changing lives and getting the message of financial feminism to as many listeners as possible.\nA great way to balance things out is to make one \u201creach\u201d goal for every \u201csafety goal.\u201d You owe it to yourself and your business to dream big. If anything, my big dreams have usually proved to be too small. So go for it \u2013\u2013 shoot for those stars!\nAs we roll along into 2022, I wish you and your small business a very happy (and profitable) holiday season!\nOne final plug: Personal Capital is the tool I check daily for managing my personal finances. You can track your net worth and your progress towards goals like saving, debt payoff, and (yes!) $100K.\nGet Started with Personal Capital\u2019s Free Financial Tools\nPersonal Capital compensates Tori Dunlap of Her First $100k (\u201cAuthor\u201d) for providing the content contained in this article.

            "content": "KEY FINDINGS\n\nRetirees fear inflation (77%) more than the rising cost of healthcare (74%).\nJust over half (58%) say that the pandemic hasn\u2019t changed their current or planned standard of living through retirement.\n3 in 4 retirees (75%) say that, despite the pandemic, they are confident that they will have enough income to live comfortably throughout retirement.\nMost retirement-age investors are staying the course. A majority (63%) say their investment outlook has not changed since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impacts have changed the mindsets \u2014 though not necessarily the plans \u2014 of those who have left the workforce.\nRetirees fear inflation more than the rising cost of healthcare, according to a recent survey\u00a0 by Personal Capital and Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance.*\nMore than 3 in 4 (77%) retirees and near-retirees cite declining purchasing power as a major concern, and that\u2019s greater than the share concerned about the cost of healthcare (74%).\n\n\u201cRetirees and near-retirees who are worried about looming inflationary pressures can stay focused on their overall investment strategy,\u201d said Jay Shah, President of Personal Capital. \u201cIt\u2019s wise to avoid letting current events drive long-term decision making.\u201d\nRespondent\u2019s top five financial concerns for the future are:\n\nRising inflation (77%)\nCost of health care (74%)\nFinancial strength of Social Security (71%)\nFinancial strength of Medicare (67%)\nA recession in the next year or two (62%)\n\n\u201cHaving a plan that\u2019s designed to endure varying conditions leading up to and during retirement is the key to increasing your financial confidence at any stage,\u201d Shah said.\nBuilding a Nest Egg\nRetirement is most peoples\u2019 biggest financial goal, and it often takes decades to save.\nAs Baby Boomers exit the workforce, many have too little stashed away to support a comfortable lifestyle. For some, the global health crisis has only exacerbated the issue. One-third (33%) of respondents say the pandemic has convinced them that they will need a bigger nest egg for retirement.\nAs a result, some near-retirees are making changes to their savings. Among respondents who are planning to retire within the next five years:\n\nMore than 4 out of 10 (41%) have already started saving more\nNearly one-quarter (24%) have delayed their retirement date, and a similar percentage say they now plan to work part-time in retirement\n\nAmong retirees, 77% survey respondents are currently collecting Social Security, with 4 out of 10 (41%) starting retirement benefits at age 62, the earliest age possible.\nUsing Stimulus Payments\nFor many, increased savings came as a result of federal stimulus checks issued throughout the pandemic.\nThe vast majority of survey respondents (86%) say they received stimulus money during the pandemic. How did near-retirees and retirees use the cash?\n\n\nNearly half (47%) saved it\nMore than one-third (35%) used it to pay bills\nNearly 1 out of 5 (18%) paid down debt\n\nRead More: Where to Stow Money for Short-Term vs. Long-Term Goals\nSpending During the Pandemic\nThe pandemic, now in its second year, has had a more immediate impact on people\u2019s current finances.\nDue to lockdowns and quarantines, a majority of survey respondents (64%) say they are spending less. Top categories for cost savings? Entertainment (57%) and transportation (43%).\nA smaller number (33%) say their overall living expenses increased over the past year. Nearly one-fourth of respondents (24%) say they are spending more on medical expenses and 17% say they are offering more financial support to family members.\nHow to Build Your Nest Egg\n\nFor those nearing retirement or already living off retirement savings, one of their most important financial responsibilities is adhering to the right spending level. Spend too much and you risk running out of money. Spend too little and you will miss out on valuable life experiences.\nFortunately for the majority of survey respondents, 3 in 4 (75%) are confident that they will have enough income to live comfortably throughout retirement.\nHere\u2019s how you can prepare for spending in retirement.\nEnvision Your Financial Goals\nImagine your dream retirement.\nDo you plan to travel extensively, dine out, spoil the grandkids, tour the country by RV, and buy a yacht? If so, you may need substantial savings to fund your lifestyle.\nOn the other hand, if you envision a simpler and more frugal retirement, you\u2019ll need less to live off.\nConsider the following questions to determine your savings needs in retirement:\n\nWhen do I want to retire?\nWhat will my income be in retirement?\nHow much do I plan to spend monthly?\nHow much will healthcare cost, based on my health?\nWould I relocate for a lower cost of living?\nHow much do I want to leave behind?\n\nCalculate It: Are You Saving Enough to Retire Comfortably?\nA retirement advisor can help you sort through your options.\nTake the example of two recent retirees, Roy and Debbie, who worked with their advisor to design their ideal post-work lifestyle. The couple had long been interested in moving to remote Montana and building a custom home, so their advisor put together an analysis of a retirement relocation.\nTogether, they considered varying expenses and alternative scenarios, and their advisor adjusted the plan to their preferences.\n\u201cWorking with our advisor made us feel comfortable,\u201d said the Personal Capital wealth management clients in an unpaid testimonial. \u201cWe were able to work through dozens of scenarios to finally have the confidence to take this huge leap.\u201d\nOther retirees and near-retirees have similar lifestyle-focused plans for their money.\n\nIdentify Your Retirement Horizon\nWhen you retire can substantially impact your golden years. Matthew Vibert, CFA, recommends evaluating both the financial as well as emotional aspects of retiring.\n\u201cIf you are unsure you are emotionally ready to retire, it doesn\u2019t hurt to work a little longer as you take the time to decide,\u201d said Vibert, Strategy and Growth Manager at Personal Capital. \u201cJust because you are financially ready does not mean it is the right time for you to retire.\u201d\nRetirees we surveyed are generally happy with their decision of when to retire. The average age at which respondents retired was 60.\nPeople who retired before age 65:\n\nSay they have no regrets about this decision (78%)\nFor those who do have regrets, 42% say it\u2019s because they could use the paycheck, while 39% say they miss work and contributing.\n\nThose who waited until 65 or later to retire:\n\nExpress no regrets with that decision (86%)\nAmong the small number of respondents who express regret with their decision to retire after age 65, the top reason (20%) was that they wish they had pursued other interests earlier.\n\nRide Out Market Volatility with a Balanced Portfolio\nInvestors we surveyed have largely stayed the course throughout the pandemic, despite a volatile stock market.\nMost (63%) respondents say their investment outlook has not changed since early 2020, even after a sudden but short-lived bear market, followed by stocks scaling to new heights.\nRetirement-age investors may want to consider adjusting their portfolio allocation for greater stability amidst market ups and downs. The asset allocation of investors remains conservative across genders, ages and whether investors are retired or not. On average, respondents\u2019 portfolios were made up of 35% stocks, 26% cash, 15% bonds, 9% real estate and 15% other.\nSince the pandemic, nearly one-third (32%) have changed their asset allocation. Of those who made changes: 13% added more stocks, 9% added bonds, and 9% increased their cash or cash-like holdings.\nA financial advisor can help you adjust your allocation in retirement and maintain your long-term outlook.\n\u201cRegardless of what the market is doing, I feel confident in knowing that I have services that were never available to me before,\u201d said Marla, a Personal Capital wealth management client, in an unpaid testimonial. \u201cI have somebody on my side who listens, responds, and really cares. She understands the idiosyncrasies of my financial life.\u201d\n*Methodology: The Kiplinger-Personal Capital national poll on The Impact of the Pandemic on Retiree Confidence was conducted June 17-24, 2021, with 772 respondents, none of which are wealth management clients of Personal Capital Advisors Corporation (\u201cPCAC\u201d). The survey has a margin of error of +/- 3.52%. Respondents were screened for age (40 and older), retirement status (fully or partially retired, or plan to retire within five years), and net worth (at least $100,000). Demographic profile: Average Age: 65; average household income before taxes in 2021: $127,688; employment status: 76% full or partially retired (Of those, 81% retired within the past 15 years); average household net worth excluding primary residence: $728,821; 49% male; 51% female.\nThe content contained in this blog post is intended for general informational purposes only and is not meant to constitute legal, tax, accounting or investment advice.

            "content": "Home buying can be a thrilling \u2014 and complicated \u2014 experience. Get insights from financial advisors with the free Personal Capital Home Buying Guide.\nThe housing market is booming.\nThe typical home value in the United States is $298,933 as of July 31, according to Zillow online real estate marketplace. It\u2019s up 16.7% compared to a year prior, and Zillow forecasts that it will increase by 12.1% the same time next year.\nIt\u2019s a very competitive market for buyers, with half of homes selling above the listing price.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t buy a house right now, especially if you\u2019re planning on owning it for a long time. If you are thinking about purchasing a home, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to make that purchase.\nCredit Requirements\nCredit requirements vary depending on the type of loan.\nTypically, the minimum credit score you need to qualify for a mortgage is around 580 for an FHA loan, which is regulated and insured by the Federal Housing Administration, or a VA loan, insured and regulated by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs.\nIt\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll qualify for a conventional mortgage, which is not guaranteed by the federal government, with a credit score below 620.\nBut the lender can decide to be more flexible depending on the size of your down payment.\nThere are no minimum credit requirements for a USDA loan. USDA loans are backed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and make homeownership more affordable for rural homebuyers.\nThere are other mortgage types to consider as well, and each has its eligibility requirements and conditions. Here\u2019s a useful resource for the most common mortgage loan types to help you determine which one is right for you.\nLike with any other credit purchase, the higher your credit score, the more advantageous your interest rate and lending terms will be. In recent months, the average fixed rates on 30-year and 15-year mortgages have been historically low, reaching 3.04% and 2.3%, respectively, in August. If you have a low credit score, consider taking the time to improve your credit so you can qualify for lower interest rates.\nDown Payment\nDo you need a 20% downpayment? No, you can put less money down, especially if it\u2019s your primary residence.\nWith a good credit score, you can get a conventional mortgage with a down payment as low as 3% of the purchase price if you\u2019re a first-time homebuyer. But, when you put less than 20% down, you have to pay private mortgage insurance or PMI on a conventional loan, which is usually around 0.5% to 1% of your loan amount every year.\nThe minimum down payment for an FHA loan is around 3.5% of the house price, but you might be required to put at least 10% down depending on your credit score. You\u2019ll have to pay a mortgage insurance premium or MIP on an FHA loan regardless of how much you\u2019re putting down. It includes a monthly premium of 0.45% to 1.05% of the loan amount per year, as well as an upfront premium fee of 1.75% of the loan amount, which can be part of the closing costs.\nA USDA loan does not require a downpayment. But, similarly to an FHA loan, there are mortgage insurance fees: one upfront of up to 1% of the loan amount and an annual fee of 0.35%.\nA down payment is not required for VA loans, and there\u2019s no private mortgage insurance. However, that option is only available to Veterans, Service Members, and select military spouses.\nPutting less than 10% down in this current market where house prices are increasing rapidly is risky. You would run the risk of being upside down on your house (owing more than the home is worth) if home prices decrease in the near future. It\u2019s important to weigh the pros and cons of having a lower down payment before deciding what\u2019s best for you. One thing that can help mitigate the risk is to ensure that before purchasing a home you have a fully funded emergency fund.\nClosing Costs\nThere are fees above the purchase price known as closing fees, which are usually between 3% and 6% of the home purchase price. Closing costs cover loan origination, appraisal, survey fees, title insurance, escrow and attorney fees, and other miscellaneous fees.\nFor the average home price of $293,349, closing fees can be between $8,800 and $17,600. First-time homebuyers are not always aware of that significant expense associated with buying a home. You should include closing fees in your budget, or it might significantly impact how much house you can purchase.\nMortgage Pre-Approval\nMost sellers require to see a mortgage pre-approval letter to consider an offer. A mortgage pre-approval letter lets the seller know that you meet all the requirements to get approved for a loan up to a certain amount. It gives a benchmark of how much a buyer can afford to spend to purchase a home.\nBefore issuing a pre-approval letter, a lender will require to see evidence of assets, income, good credit, employment verification, and possibly additional documents. A mortgage pre-approval is different from a mortgage pre-qualification, which estimates how much credit a potential buyer can afford based on numbers provided by the borrower without verification by the lender.\nFinding a Mortgage Lender\nWhen looking for a loan, there are several options to consider, from conventional banks to credit unions or online lenders.\nMost lenders today give you the option to apply online before being assigned a mortgage loan officer. A good lender should help you find the best option for you instead of only providing quotes.\nYou might be more inclined to use a traditional bank or credit union if you already have an account at the institution.\nA credit union might offer more competitive rates than a traditional bank and more personalized service. Though membership might seem intimidating, you usually need to have a common bond with other credit union members to be eligible. There are many credit unions, and finding a suitable one shouldn\u2019t be too much of a hassle.\nIn my experience, online brokers have provided the best offers and a more convenient way to shop around for the most competitive rates. But, you should be prepared to receive many phone calls from companies offering to work with you on your mortgage or other services. If you have a secondary number, consider using it instead of your primary number.\nA nonbank mortgage lender does not offer traditional banking services but can provide various loan options, possibly at a quicker turnaround than a conventional bank.\nYou can also work with a mortgage broker to review offers from various lenders and find the best option for you.\nEmployment & Income Requirements\nTo determine if you qualify for a loan and how much you can borrow, a lender will look at your income and employment history. The typical documents that a lender requests to verify employment and income are:\n\nAn employment verification letter.\nTwo years of tax returns.\nProof of income for the past two years.\n\nDepending on if you are an employee or a contractor, you will need to provide two years of W-2s or 1040s. If you\u2019re self-employed, the lender will likely ask for additional documentation and possibly contact your Certified Public Accountant to help determine if your business is stable enough to grant you a loan.\nLenders will also review your income. According to the 28/36 rule, you shouldn\u2019t spend more than 28% and 36% of your gross monthly income on your housing expenses and debt payments, respectively. You might still qualify for a loan if you don\u2019t meet the 28/36 rule, but it\u2019s a good reference point as you assess how much house you can afford.\nDebt-to-Income Ratio\nThe debt-to-income ratio is a metric lenders use to determine whether to grant you a loan. The debt-to-income ratio, or DTI, is the percentage of your gross monthly income that you spend towards paying off debt. To determine your DTI, you divide the total amount of your recurring debt (car payments, rent, student loan debt) by your monthly income. For instance, if your debt is $2,000 per month and your monthly income is $6.000, your DTI is 0.33 or 33%. The higher your DTI, the riskier of an investment you are for a potential lender; very few lenders will issue a mortgage loan if your debt-to-income ratio is higher than 43%.\nThe Bottom Line\nBuying a house, especially for the first time, can be a stressful experience. Being informed about the process and gathering the information you need to provide to be approved for a loan can help make the experience less overwhelming.\nFor more insights, check out the free Personal Capital Home Buying Guide.

            "content": "KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nFirst-time investors associate the stock market with the most short-term, most profitable, and favorite form of investment, while they associate bonds with the most long-term and cryptocurrency with the most volatile.\nTwo in 3 first-time investors are aware of capital gains tax and understand how it works.\nRoughly 43% of first-time investors utilize growth investing (seeking investments with strong potential upside) as their primary investment strategy.\nThe top 3 forms of investments recommended by seasoned investors for first-time investors were the stock market (68.5%), index fund (58.4%), and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) (40.1%).\n\nEntering the World of Investing\nSticking the first toe in the pool of investing today can be a daunting experience. After all, that pool is much bigger than it used to be: Opportunities like crypto and NFTs and minimum-fee trading apps are all options only available within the last two decades. Even older options like the stock market are now subject to influences like the pandemic or the subreddit, Wall Street Bets. In short, getting started can be scary.\nWanting to know how new investors are thinking and behaving in 2021, we surveyed 800 of them, as well as 200 seasoned investors. We asked about their strategies, their levels of trust, and even quizzed them on their knowledge. With both more to know and more places to find that knowledge, new investors revealed some pretty interesting trends. In fact, after speaking to seasoned investors, newcomers may be smarter investors than they\u2019re given credit for. Keep reading to see their insights.\nDemographics of First-Timers\nFirst, we wanted to know what a first-time investor looks like today. Are the people just now getting involved mostly men or women? How old are they? How educated? And exactly how much are they investing to get started? The first component of our study answers these questions below.\n\nThough the gender wage gap corners much of the conversation, there\u2019s a gender investment gap that may be hurting women more. According to a report by SoFi, on average, women hold 71% of their assets in cash, while men hold just 60%. Our study revealed, however, that this gap may be showing signs of closing. Our findings showed that roughly the same percentage of new investors are men and women, though first-timers are still skewed slightly male.\nAs far as age is concerned, first-time investor respondents are relatively old (33 years of age) and have presumably been in the working world for about a decade. That said, 20% of respondents getting involved in investing today are between the ages of 18 and 24 and may not even be financially independent yet. It\u2019s also important to note the importance of starting early, especially for goals like retirement and longer-term growth.\nFirst-time investor respondents also revealed a tendency to \u201cgo big.\u201d In other words, they were averaging an investment equivalent to 23.4% of their monthly income. That said, higher earners were investing closer to 35%, or over a third of their monthly salaries. The younger a first-time investor was, generally the higher their percentage investment to income would go as well.\nNewbie Knowledge\nNext, our study dug into the knowledge base of people just getting started with investing. We asked them which forms of investment they understood, what associations they had with each form of investing, and what tax-related practices they preferred.\n\nAccording to self-reported data among first-time investors, the stock market was the most readily understood form of investing. Nearly three-quarters of this group claimed to have an understanding of the stock market, while just 29.9% understood exchange-traded funds (ETFs), despite the fact that ETFs tend to have a large basket of investments to allow for greater diversification. In spite of its newness and volatility, cryptocurrency was understood relatively often \u2013 42.7% said they understood this form of investment.\nDigging into more detail, we found that first-time investors seemed to be associating that understanding of cryptocurrency with volatility. As a result, respondents perceived that these fluctuating coins, like Bitcoin, were better associated with shorter-term investments (21.0%) rather than longer-term investments (11.8%). Stocks, on the other hand, were more often associated with \u201cshort-term\u201d investments.\nWhile a majority of new investors didn\u2019t choose investment types based on how tax-efficient they were, they still made an effort to contribute to tax-efficient accounts. In other words, more than half (51.5%) of the respondents were contributing to their 401ks or IRAs, but only 37.4% chose tax-efficient investments.\nCapital Gains Knowledge\nA capital gains tax is a tax on the growth in value of investments incurred when selling those investments. You only owe these taxes if you realize a profit from the sale. Do you think first-time investors knew this? This next part of our study answers that question.\n\nMost, but certainly not all, first-time investor respondents understood how the capital gains tax worked. The more money a person made, the more this understanding increased, likely due to increased experience with actually paying those taxes. Education also helped increase capital gains knowledge considerably.\nWe were pleasantly surprised to see the educational opportunity that respondents were finding in personal finance blogs. In fact, those who used personal finance blogs to do their finance research were more likely than even those who read financial news websites to understand the capital gains tax. With the influx of new investors, it would logically follow that new sources of information, like personal finance blogs, would also come on the scene.\nNewcomer Strategies\nWhat are the strategies of an investing newcomer like? And where are they finding this information? Do particular information sources encourage particular types of investment? This next piece of our study seeks to find out.\n\nThe favorite strategy of first-time investor respondents was growth investing or seeking investments with strong potential upsides. Roughly forty-three percent of newcomers chose this option. That said, 18% demonstrated interest in momentum investing, or buying stocks experiencing an uptrend. Roughly the same amount started with dollar-cost averaging (DCA), which means making regular investments in the market over time. Of course, these strategies can overlap in terms of actual investments.\nFinancial news websites were still the No. 1 informational source of choice for most investment types, with one key exception: NFTs. NFT, which stands for non-fungible token, is essentially a digital asset that represents tangible things like art or videos. Even in the words of Forbes Magazine, \u201cthey exploded out of the ether this year.\u201d To get education on NFTs, first-time investors were shying away from news websites in favor of YouTube. Those who chose to invest in NFTs were more likely to have gained their information from YouTube than any other platform.\nPreferred Platforms\nAnd speaking of platforms, the next part of our study looks at which platforms were being used for actual investment transactions among newcomers. We asked which platforms they used and which platforms they trusted. We also asked how much they were investing with each particular strategy employed.\n\nRetail investing platforms were the most popular choice. Retail investing essentially enables nonprofessional investors to purchase assets. Institutional exchange platforms, which make decisions on behalf of individuals or shareholders instead of themselves, were also a popular choice: 51.1% of first-time investors chose this option.\nEven though more people chose retail investing, institutional exchange platforms demonstrated a much higher level of trust among respondents. Following the GME shorting situation in January 2021, 48.6% of first-time investors maintained a positive perception toward commission-free trading platforms, while 19.1% developed a negative perception. More than a quarter of first-time investors felt the platforms they use handled it well, while 28.2% of first-time investors weren\u2019t impacted by this occurrence.\nOverall, the stock market still garnered the largest percentage investment from first-timers ($2,494, on average) followed by index funds ($2,310, on average). Only 5.4% of first-timers picked NFTs, but the average investment amount wasn\u2019t the smallest. Bonds, which were chosen by 39.1% of first-time investors, only received an average investment of a little over $1716.\nSeasoned Investors Weigh In\nOur study wraps up with an analysis of more than 200 seasoned investors. We asked them what they recommended for first-time investors specifically in terms of both strategy and specific investments. They also shared their sentiments surrounding things like cryptos and NFTs, and they even admitted to the mistakes they made when starting.\n\nInstitutional exchange platforms, which most first-timer respondents trusted but did not ultimately choose, were the top platform recommendation among seasoned respondents. That said, more than half still recommended retail investing platforms, which we saw that first-timers were particularly drawn toward. Seasoned vets and newbies also overlapped in their choice of strategy and investment: Growth investing and stocks were the No. 1 choice for both groups.\nLooking back, most seasoned respondents agreed that their biggest mistake was seeking a fast profit instead of patiently waiting for gains over time. They also lamented having invested without doing adequate research (52.2%) and committing a lot of money at once (49.3%).\nMany seasoned respondents were still skeptical about NFTs and cryptocurrency. Only 47.3% of this group felt positive about crypto as an investment, and only 38% felt positive about NFTs. Fear not, as time will ultimately tell. Surprisingly enough, seasoned investors maintained a more positive sentiment towards Wall Street Bets (52.7% positive), the controversial subreddit, than cryptocurrency or NFTs.\nTakeaways From First-Time Investors\nAs evidence and our seasoned respondents revealed, first-timer respondents aren\u2019t getting much wrong.\u00a0 Both groups of respondents most often chose growth-oriented strategies, stock picks, and ETFs. Seasoned respondents were also relatively trusting of some newer sources of information, like Wall Street Bets, and even those who read blogs over trusted news sources were often the most informed.\nAbout half of seasoned investor respondents recommended working with a financial advisor, while fewer than 2% of new investors did so. But we believe blending financial advisors with tech is an even more promising (and more affordable) option for new and seasoned investors alike.

Of the 800 first-time investors surveyed, 47% were women, 52.9% were men, and 0.1% identified as nonbinary. Additionally, the average age of these respondents was 33.3 with a standard deviation of 9.7 years.\nFor the second half of the study, we collected responses from 205 seasoned investors, defined as retail investors with over 5 years of investing experience, via Amazon MTurk. Of the 205 seasoned investors surveyed, 29.8% were women, 69.8% were men, and 0.4% identified as nonbinary. Additionally, the average age of these respondents was 40.1 with a standard deviation of 11.1 years.\nThe main limitation of this study is the reliance on self-report, which is faced with several issues such as, but not limited to, attribution, exaggeration, recency bias, and telescoping.\nFair Use Statement\nGetting yourself and others financially invested for a chance to grow wealth is a noble cause.

Are the people just now getting involved mostly men or women? How old are they? How educated? And exactly how much are they investing to get started? The first component of our study answers these questions below.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52427 size-full\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1_Who_Are_FirstTime_Investors_in_2021.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1332\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1_Who_Are_FirstTime_Investors_in_2021.png 800w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1_Who_Are_FirstTime_Investors_in_2021-150x250.png 150w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1_Who_Are_FirstTime_Investors_in_2021-334x556.png 334w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1_Who_Are_FirstTime_Investors_in_2021-768x1279.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Though the gender wage gap corners much of the conversation, there\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/financial-feminism-closing-the-gender-wealth-gap/\">gender investment gap</a> that may be hurting women more. According to a report by SoFi, on average, women <a href=\"https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/male-vs-female-investment-behavior/\">hold 71% of their assets in cash</a>, while men hold just 60%. Our study revealed, however, that this gap may be showing signs of closing. Our findings showed that roughly the same percentage of new investors are men and women, though first-timers are still skewed slightly male.</p>\n<p>As far as age is concerned, first-time investor respondents are relatively old (33 years of age) and have presumably been in the working world for about a decade. That said, 20% of respondents getting involved in investing today are between the ages of 18 and 24 and may not even be financially independent yet. It\u2019s also important to note the importance of starting early, especially for goals like retirement and longer-term growth.</p>\n<p>First-time investor respondents also revealed a tendency to \u201cgo big.\u201d In other words, they were averaging an investment equivalent to 23.4% of their monthly income. That said, higher earners were investing closer to 35%, or over a third of their monthly salaries. The younger a first-time investor was, generally the higher their percentage investment to income would go as well.</p>\n<h2>Newbie Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Next, our study dug into the knowledge base of people just getting started with investing. We asked them which forms of investment they understood, what associations they had with each form of investing, and what tax-related practices they preferred.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52428 size-full\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2_Investment_Knowledge_of_FirstTime_Investors.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1499\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2_Investment_Knowledge_of_FirstTime_Investors.png 800w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2_Investment_Knowledge_of_FirstTime_Investors-133x250.png 133w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2_Investment_Knowledge_of_FirstTime_Investors-297x556.png 297w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2_Investment_Knowledge_of_FirstTime_Investors-768x1439.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>According to self-reported data among first-time investors, the stock market was the most readily understood form of investing. Nearly three-quarters of this group claimed to have an understanding of the stock market, while just 29.9% understood exchange-traded funds (ETFs), despite the fact that ETFs tend to have a large basket of investments to allow for greater diversification. In spite of its newness and volatility, cryptocurrency was understood relatively often \u2013 42.7% said they understood this form of investment.</p>\n<p>Digging into more detail, we found that first-time investors seemed to be associating that understanding of cryptocurrency with volatility. As a result, respondents perceived that these fluctuating coins, like Bitcoin, were better associated with shorter-term investments (21.0%) rather than longer-term investments (11.8%). Stocks, on the other hand, were more often associated with \u201cshort-term\u201d investments.</p>\n<p>While a majority of new investors didn\u2019t choose investment types based on how tax-efficient they were, they still made an effort to contribute to tax-efficient accounts. In other words, more than half (51.5%) of the respondents were contributing to their 401ks or IRAs, but only 37.4% chose tax-efficient investments.</p>\n<h2>Capital Gains Knowledge</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/taxes-insurance/personal-capital-tax-series-7-the-capital-gains-tax/\">capital gains tax</a> is a tax on the growth in value of investments incurred when selling those investments. You only owe these taxes if you realize a profit from the sale. Do you think first-time investors knew this? This next part of our study answers that question.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52429 size-full\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3_Understadning_Capital_Gains_Tax.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1751\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3_Understadning_Capital_Gains_Tax.png 800w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3_Understadning_Capital_Gains_Tax-114x250.png 114w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3_Understadning_Capital_Gains_Tax-254x556.png 254w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3_Understadning_Capital_Gains_Tax-768x1681.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3_Understadning_Capital_Gains_Tax-702x1536.png 702w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Most, but certainly not all, first-time investor respondents understood how the capital gains tax worked. The more money a person made, the more this understanding increased, likely due to increased experience with actually paying those taxes. Education also helped increase capital gains knowledge considerably.</p>\n<p>We were pleasantly surprised to see the educational opportunity that respondents were finding in personal finance blogs. In fact, those who used personal finance blogs to do their finance research were more likely than even those who read financial news websites to understand the capital gains tax. With the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/2020-was-a-big-year-for-individual-investors-5094063\">influx of new investors</a>, it would logically follow that new sources of information, like <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/\">personal finance blogs</a>, would also come on the scene.</p>\n<h2>Newcomer Strategies</h2>\n<p>What are the strategies of an investing newcomer like? And where are they finding this information? Do particular information sources encourage particular types of investment? This next piece of our study seeks to find out.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52430 size-full\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4_Investment_Strategies_and_Influence.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1780\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4_Investment_Strategies_and_Influence.png 800w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4_Investment_Strategies_and_Influence-112x250.png 112w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4_Investment_Strategies_and_Influence-250x556.png 250w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4_Investment_Strategies_and_Influence-768x1709.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4_Investment_Strategies_and_Influence-690x1536.png 690w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>The favorite strategy of first-time investor respondents was growth investing or seeking investments with strong potential upsides. Roughly forty-three percent of newcomers chose this option. That said, 18% demonstrated interest in momentum investing, or buying stocks experiencing an uptrend. Roughly the same amount started with dollar-cost averaging (DCA), which means making regular investments in the market over time. Of course, these strategies can overlap in terms of actual investments.</p>\n<p>Financial news websites were still the No. 1 informational source of choice for most investment types, with one key exception: NFTs. NFT, which stands for non-fungible token, is essentially a digital asset that represents tangible things like art or videos. Even in the words of <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/nft-non-fungible-token/\">Forbes Magazine</a>, \u201cthey exploded out of the ether this year.\u201d To get education on NFTs, first-time investors were shying away from news websites in favor of YouTube. Those who chose to invest in NFTs were more likely to have gained their information from YouTube than any other platform.</p>\n<h2>Preferred Platforms</h2>\n<p>And speaking of platforms, the next part of our study looks at which platforms were being used for actual investment transactions among newcomers. We asked which platforms they used and which platforms they trusted. We also asked how much they were investing with each particular strategy employed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52431 size-full\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5_Favorite_Platforms_and_Investments.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1599\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5_Favorite_Platforms_and_Investments.png 800w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5_Favorite_Platforms_and_Investments-125x250.png 125w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5_Favorite_Platforms_and_Investments-278x556.png 278w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5_Favorite_Platforms_and_Investments-768x1536.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Retail investing platforms were the most popular choice. Retail investing essentially enables nonprofessional investors to purchase assets. Institutional exchange platforms, which make decisions on behalf of individuals or shareholders instead of themselves, were also a popular choice: 51.1% of first-time investors chose this option.</p>\n<p>Even though more people chose retail investing, institutional exchange platforms demonstrated a much higher level of trust among respondents. Following the <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/27/22252600/gamestop-stock-gme-why-whats-happening-explain\">GME shorting situation</a> in January 2021, 48.6% of first-time investors maintained a positive perception toward commission-free trading platforms, while 19.1% developed a negative perception. More than a quarter of first-time investors felt the platforms they use handled it well, while 28.2% of first-time investors weren\u2019t impacted by this occurrence.</p>\n<p>Overall, the stock market still garnered the largest percentage investment from first-timers ($2,494, on average) followed by index funds ($2,310, on average). Only 5.4% of first-timers picked NFTs, but the average investment amount wasn\u2019t the smallest. Bonds, which were chosen by 39.1% of first-time investors, only received an average investment of a little over $1716.</p>\n<h2>Seasoned Investors Weigh In</h2>\n<p>Our study wraps up with an analysis of more than 200 seasoned investors. We asked them what they recommended for first-time investors specifically in terms of both strategy and specific investments. They also shared their sentiments surrounding things like cryptos and NFTs, and they even admitted to the mistakes they made when starting.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52432 size-full\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6_Seasoned_Investors_Recommendations.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1651\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6_Seasoned_Investors_Recommendations.png 800w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6_Seasoned_Investors_Recommendations-121x250.png 121w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6_Seasoned_Investors_Recommendations-269x556.png 269w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6_Seasoned_Investors_Recommendations-768x1585.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6_Seasoned_Investors_Recommendations-744x1536.png 744w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Institutional exchange platforms, which most first-timer respondents trusted but did not ultimately choose, were the top platform recommendation among seasoned respondents. That said, more than half still recommended retail investing platforms, which we saw that first-timers were particularly drawn toward. Seasoned vets and newbies also overlapped in their choice of strategy and investment: Growth investing and stocks were the No. 1 choice for both groups.</p>\n<p>Looking back, most seasoned respondents agreed that their biggest mistake was seeking a fast profit instead of patiently waiting for gains over time. They also lamented having invested without doing adequate research (52.2%) and committing a lot of money at once (49.3%).</p>\n<p>Many seasoned respondents were still skeptical about NFTs and cryptocurrency. Only 47.3% of this group felt positive about crypto as an investment, and only 38% felt positive about NFTs. Fear not, as time will ultimately tell. Surprisingly enough, seasoned investors maintained a more positive sentiment towards Wall Street Bets (52.7% positive), the controversial subreddit, than cryptocurrency or NFTs.</p>\n<h2>Takeaways From First-Time Investors</h2>\n<p>As evidence and our seasoned respondents revealed, first-timer respondents aren\u2019t getting much wrong.\u00a0 Both groups of respondents most often chose growth-oriented strategies, stock picks, and ETFs. Seasoned respondents were also relatively trusting of some newer sources of information, like Wall Street Bets, and even those who read blogs over trusted news sources were often the most informed.</p>\n<p>About half of seasoned investor respondents recommended working with a financial advisor, while fewer than 2% of new investors did so. But we believe blending financial advisors with tech is an even more promising (and more affordable) option for new and seasoned investors alike.

Of the 800 first-time investors surveyed, 47% were women, 52.9% were men, and 0.1% identified as nonbinary. Additionally, the average age of these respondents was 33.3 with a standard deviation of 9.7 years.</p>\n<p>For the second half of the study, we collected responses from 205 seasoned investors, defined as retail investors with over 5 years of investing experience, via Amazon MTurk. Of the 205 seasoned investors surveyed, 29.8% were women, 69.8% were men, and 0.4% identified as nonbinary. Additionally, the average age of these respondents was 40.1 with a standard deviation of 11.1 years.</p>\n<p>The main limitation of this study is the reliance on self-report, which is faced with several issues such as, but not limited to, attribution, exaggeration, recency bias, and telescoping.</p>\n<h2>Fair Use Statement</h2>\n<p>Getting yourself and others financially invested for a chance to grow wealth is a noble cause.

            "content": "KEY FINDINGS\n\nFinancial health is rooted in a sense of freedom. The vast majority of recent survey respondents (81%) say, \u201cI will feel financially well when I have the freedom and ability to spend how I want to.\u201d\nFinancial wellbeing can also feel elusive. A majority (60%) feel confident in their ability to achieve financial health, but only 48% feel financially healthy today.\nNearly 7 in 10 (69%) face at least one roadblock to financial wellness. Lack of income (27%) and constant expenses (23%) are top barriers.\nMost people think they won\u2019t achieve financial health until nearly age 50 \u2013 or when they have over half a million dollars in the bank.\n\n\u00a0\nFinancial health can be difficult to universally characterize. It hinges on a person\u2019s age, life situation, long-term goals, and myriad other factors. In short, one definition does not fit all.\nWe asked everyday investors to describe the term in their own words. The results, according to our joint survey with Empower-Retirement,* demonstrated that financial health boils down to one important concept: financial freedom.\nThe vast majority of our survey respondents (81%) agree, \u201cI will feel financially well when I have the freedom and ability to spend how I want to.\u201d\nHere\u2019s how one investor describes his sense of financial health:\n\u201cIt means that I understand where we are financially. When we make a decision to purchase or do something, we don\u2019t have to second guess whether we\u2019re making the right decision or not \u2014 at least from a financial perspective. It\u2019s a luxury not to have to question every purchase.\u201d\n\u2014 Bill H., a Personal Capital investment client in an unpaid testimonial\nOf course, this peace of mind isn\u2019t instantaneous. It likely comes after building solid financial habits over time. Indeed, most survey respondents agree that \u201cfinancial health is more of an ongoing journey\u201d (72%), rather than \u201cachieving a specific milestone\u201d (28%).\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the pandemic, Americans have changed their relationship with money, and as a result, how they define financial wellness,\u201d said Edmund F. Murphy III, President and CEO of Empower Retirement. \u201cNow it becomes even more important to help Americans with a personalized, holistic view of their finances and savings goals.\u201d\nFollowing are insights from \u201cThe Journey Toward Financial Freedom.\u201d\nWhat Americans Need to Feel Financially Healthy\nOur survey respondents offered insights into the figures of financial health:\n\nhow old they think they need to be in order to feel financially well\nhow much they need to have saved to feel financially well\n\nThese numbers varied according to generation and gender.\nGenerational Breakdowns\n\nMost people think they won\u2019t achieve financial health until nearly age 50 \u2013 or when they have over half a million dollars in the bank.\nIn general, younger respondents think they need less money at a younger age to feel financially healthy. Gen Z respondents are optimistic that they\u2019ll achieve a sense of financial wellness at a younger age than their peers. Boomers, on the other hand, feel slightly behind others their age.\nGen X may be the generation of supersavers, as they think they need the most money to feel financially well.\nSavings are only one part of the overall picture of a person\u2019s financial health.\nThe majority of our survey respondents (73%) say net worth is a top indicator of how financially healthy they are. But far fewer (66%) can actually estimate their net worth.\nTry It: Calculate Your Net Worth\nAccording to what we see across the 3 million people who use the Personal Capital Dashboard, the median net worth doesn\u2019t surpass $500,000 until a person reaches age 60 \u2014 much later than our survey respondents anticipate attaining a sense of financial health.\nSo what can people do to play catch up? Personal Capital\u2019s certified financial advisors weigh in with tips for increasing your net worth throughout your lifetime.\nRead More: The Average Net Worth By Age\nGender Breakdowns\nOn average, the men we surveyed believe financial health comes sooner and with higher savings than women.\nOur male respondents say an investor needs to sock away $624,666 \u2014 more than the general public believes is necessary for financial health. Women think you need less than average ($402,838). This could be because women, on average, earn 84% of what men earn and, therefore, are likely to save less over their lifetime. In addition to lower wages, women overall are less likely to invest, and when they do, they invest less but live seven years longer on average.\nMen in our survey think financial health comes at age 45 \u2014 about four years sooner than women. In their personal lives, men feel financially healthy at about 47; women on average feel healthy at age 51.\nThe wage and investing gaps have put women at a disadvantage in their potential to build wealth. How can these gaps be closed? One catalyst is financial education on wealth drivers like compensation negotiation and long-term investing.\nRead More: Closing the Gender Wealth Gap\nHow Americans Self-Rate Their Financial Health in the Pandemic\n\nEven under normal circumstances, money management is a core component of overall wellness. Our survey found that 77% of Americans agree \u201cmy financial health also affects my physical and mental health.\u201d\nMost respondents (60%) report feeling confident in their ability to achieve financial health, but only 48% feel financially healthy today.\nNumerous factors impact people\u2019s sense of financial wellness. The majority of our survey respondents (69%) say they face at least one roadblock to financial wellbeing. The highest barriers? Lack of income (27%) and expenses constantly piling up (27%).\nNot everyone\u2019s finances have been adversely affected by the global health and economic crisis. Thanks to reduced spending and stimulus payouts, some Americans increased their savings during the pandemic. The pandemic also impacted financial mindsets.\n\nSurvey respondents see an emergency fund as an increasingly important priority. Data from Personal Capital\u2019s user base indicates the same \u2014 particularly among younger investors. People in their 20s park a higher percentage of their assets in cash (28.4%) than any other age group, except retirees in their 80s (29.4%) and 90s (31%).\nThe median cash balance in the portfolios of those in their 20s is $31,589. Investors in their 30s keep 25.4% of their portfolio assets in cash (with a median cash balance of $53,377).\nHow to Work Toward Financial Freedom\nIf \u2014 like our survey respondents \u2014 your ultimate goal is being able to spend how you want, following are five tips to move you closer to financial freedom.\n\n\nTrack Your Net Worth\n\n\nKnowing where you stand is the first step toward where you want to be.\nOne investor who learned this personally is Andy Hill, a financial podcaster and father who achieved the financial milestone of becoming a millionaire in his 30s. He and his wife Nicole started their wealth-building process with the simple exercise of identifying their net worth: a disheartening -$50,000.\nBut they weren\u2019t deterred. \u201cAfter getting over that momentary financial depression, I realized this wasn\u2019t something to be sad about,\u201d Andy wrote on Daily Capital. \u201cThis was an opportunity to change the course of our lives and the lives of our future children.\u201d\nIn your own planning, decide what you want to achieve within a given timeframe and work backward from there.\nRead More: How Tracking Our Net Worth Motivated Us to Achieve Financial Freedom\n\n\nSet Financial Priorities\n\n\nOnce you have a holistic understanding of your finances, you can start to set your financial priorities. These priorities are the big-picture ways you want to use your money. Setting these priorities can feel overwhelming.\nWrite down your plan for achieving your financial goals, recommends Brian Cocos, CFP\u00ae, a Personal Capital advisor.\n\u201cThis will give you something you can refer back to periodically to make sure you remain on track,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should review your financial plan every 12 to 18 months to monitor your progress and make adjustments as necessary.\u201d\n\n\nEstablish an Emergency Fund\n\n\nOf our survey respondents, 51% say having an emergency fund is their highest financial priority amidst the pandemic.\nMost experts suggest saving enough cash to cover three to six months of expenses based on your average monthly spending. First, calculate your average monthly spending. Be sure to exclude discretionary spending like dining out, travel or shopping. Concentrate on your unavoidable costs \u2014 housing, insurance, transportation, food, debt payments, and the like. Tip: You can do this automatically with Personal Capital\u2019s online financial tools.\nOnce you have your number, multiply by the amount of months you\u2019d like to save for. As your circumstances change, your savings goal may need adjustments, too.\nRead More: How Much Should You Have in an Emergency Fund?\n\n\nInvest Consistently (and Automatically)\n\n\nInvesting to achieve financial freedom requires discipline and a long-term perspective.\nThis can be difficult when you\u2019re faced with more pressing financial priorities and emergencies, like home repairs and unexpected medical expenses. Investing can also be an emotional challenge during times of market volatility.\nCocos, the Personal Capital advisor, suggests developing discipline with a strategy known as dollar-cost averaging. That means investing the same amount of money at regular intervals, such as each pay period, usually via an automatic investing plan.\nThis way, your investments are spread out evenly over time, which could result in buying more shares at lower prices and fewer shares at higher prices.\n\u201cAlso,\u201d Cocos added, \u201cwe are creatures of habit, so something that is easy and automated will likely continue without contest, helping grow your balances.\u201d\n\n\nCreate Ongoing Financial Habits\n\n\nIndeed, from what we eat to when we sleep, many people appreciate a normal routine. Our survey indicates that finances follow suit: 69% say sticking to a consistent savings approach is vital to generating financial wellness.\nOne way to keep savings constant? Set it and forget it. Send cash to your savings account if you\u2019re squirreling away money for your emergency fund or a big-ticket, near-term expense. Otherwise, direct your income toward long-term investments, as Cocos recommends.\nYou can stay on track by minding your progress. Be sure to:\n\nReview and categorize your spending to stay within your budget\nKeep an eye on your investments, especially hidden fees\nFocus on long-term goals like buying a home or retiring from work\n\nOne way to build these financial habits is by using online money-management tools like the Personal Capital Dashboard. More than 3 million U.S. households use this technology to get an overview of their finances, all in one place, and track their net worth over time.\nThe bottom line? Financial wellness is personal. Establishing healthy practices is the best way to work toward your definition of financial freedom.\nRead the eBook: The Journey Toward Financial Freedom\n*This survey was conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of Empower Retirement and Personal Capital from March 23 to April 5, 2021.

Drastic market swings and unpredictable events are the last thing investors want to see, especially as retirement savings hang in the balance.\nWe used anonymized Personal Capital user data in conjunction with a survey of more than 1,000 people with a current retirement plan about the reality of their retirement savings. We examined who is currently following best practices, what changes people have made or contemplated since the onset of the pandemic, and what people wish they\u2019d done differently when it comes to setting themselves up for retirement. Continue reading to see what we found.\nThe State of Retirement Accounts at the Close of 2020\n\nAs the coronavirus expanded beyond the borders of China back in March, fears of a global pandemic sent markets plunging. That initial drop actually manifested three of the worst percentage point drops in U.S. history.\nThe markets have since rebounded, and it appears that people looking to bolster their retirement savings appeared to bounce back from the initial shock of the pandemic. Personal Capital\u2019s user data on average monthly 401(k) contributions show that the average amount people contributed dropped in April and May \u2013 across all age groups \u2013 as uncertainty around the impact of COVID-19 ran wild.\nThe tentative optimism of the summer seemed to level off, though, as average amounts contributed gradually decreased again in October and November. This could be due to the surge of virus cases in the U.S. recent months, throwing the country into what many are calling a \u201cCOVID winter.\u201d\nRetirement Savings Practices in 2020\nIt\u2019s not a stretch to think that people\u2019s habits around saving for retirement may have changed since the onset of the pandemic. In terms of best practices, the current habits of the people we surveyed were a mixed bag.\n\nOver 50% of people reported currently contributing to their 401(k) every paycheck. People in their 30s, though, were most likely to report doing so. Experts typically consider people\u2019s 40s and 50s to be the highest-earning decades of their careers. So developing the habit of saving while in their 30s could be setting these people up well to be able to maintain and accelerate savings when their earnings reach their peak.\nAround 49% said they were receiving the maximum match from their employer. There could be a number of reasons why more people aren\u2019t getting a full match. Around a quarter of our respondents (23%) reported currently being retired. Additionally, many employers have found themselves in the position of needing to cut costs to stay afloat amid the economic fallout of the pandemic, and temporarily reducing or cutting 401(k) contributions is a fairly straightforward step and one that has been implemented during previous economic downturns.\nOnly 33% of people overall said they were aligning their retirement accounts with their goals and risk tolerance. While risk tolerance fluctuates throughout a person\u2019s lifetime, it\u2019s particularly important to consider when getting closer to retirement age. Younger investors can afford to take on more risk as they have a longer stretch to make up for any dips in value. This can explain why people aged 60-plus were most likely to say they were aligning accounts with their goals and risk tolerance.\nTaking Action in a Global Pandemic\nThe pandemic has been impacting the U.S. for nearly eight months now, and a lot has happened since the coronavirus first starting wreaking havoc. We had surveyed people on their concern about the virus\u2019 impact on their finances versus their health earlier in the pandemic, so we wanted to check how views had evolved.\n\nOver 72% of people said they were most concerned about COVID-19\u2019s impact on their health, while only 27.8% said they were more concerned about the pandemic\u2019s impact on their retirement savings. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that finances and health are inextricably linked where COVID-19 is concerned. Treatment for COVID-19, depending on severity, can run tens of thousands of dollars. Add the fact that unemployment has left many people uninsured, and the link between health and finances becomes all the more prominent.\n\nPeople were also asked about actions they may have taken since the pandemic that have impacted their finances and retirement readiness. Nearly 43% reported that they\u2019d started a side hustle specifically to save or contribute more to retirement. Nearly 30% reported starting their own business or becoming self-employed, with men being more likely than women to report doing this.\nAmerican Investors Feel Like They Are Not Doing Enough For Retirement During COVID-19\n\nDeveloping and practicing good habits around retirement planning is difficult even without a global pandemic. People were asked to report where they had fallen short before when trying to save for retirement. They were asked to report if they had ever done something, regardless of when or circumstances. Given that gender has a large impact on finances (see the gender pay gap) and that women have shown to be most vulnerable to the financial impacts of COVID-19, we looked at differences in past retirement savings actions by gender.\nWomen were more likely than men to say they\u2019d failed to save enough (46.7% compared to 39.1%). However, men were more likely to say they\u2019d made a risky investment before. A big gender difference was also found concerning neglecting to rebalance a portfolio: 28.3% of men said they\u2019d overlooked rebalancing a portfolio before, compared to just 21.1% of women.\n\nThe actions people have taken, both good and bad, concerning their retirement aren\u2019t just different by gender. Age can also impact what people have done in regard to their savings. Where people are in their life can impact how they view their retirement situation.\nFor example, 50.6% of people aged 60+ said they\u2019d not saved enough at some point, compared to just 28.5% of people in their 20s who felt the same. It could be that people in their 20s are so early on in their careers and retirement saving journey that they underestimate what they\u2019ll need for retirement.\nPeople in their 50s were most likely to say they\u2019d ever made a risky investment, though 43.5% of people in their 20s said the same. Meanwhile, people in their 20s, who are likely new to investing, were the most likely to say they\u2019ve made the mistake of not planning for taxes.\nReflecting on Past Retirement Decisions After a Difficult Year\n\nEveryone makes mistakes. With experience comes the knowledge that some decisions may not have been the best moves to make at the time.\nPeople were asked how they wished they\u2019d handled their retirement savings in hindsight, particularly whether they wish they\u2019d been more conservative or more aggressive. Interestingly, people were fairly split on this, with 39% of people saying they wish they\u2019d been more conservative and another 39.3% saying they wish they\u2019d been more aggressive. More than 1 in 5 people said they would make no change.\nNearly 86% of respondents reported having at least some regrets about previous retirement savings decisions they\u2019d made, with 9% saying they regretted previous decisions to an extreme extent.\nStaying on Track in Tough Times\nWhile findings show that many people are still following retirement savings best practices and working on building the financial future they want in retirement, the coronavirus pandemic has prompted Americans to consider and take actions they might not have otherwise, like decreasing retirement contributions and taking coronavirus-related distributions from their retirement accounts.\nWhile a majority of people reported being more concerned about the pandemic\u2019s impact on their health than on their retirement savings, many still reported regrets about past retirement savings decisions and wished they\u2019d decided to take different approaches with their retirement savings strategy.\nPersonal Capital combines expert financial advice with an intuitive interface, giving you an easy way to monitor your accounts and investments.This can give you more control over your goals and your financial future.

As we see in the study, you\u2019re not alone in feeling this way! It\u2019s never too late to change the course of your retirement \u2014 you may have to make some adjustments like working longer, but what we\u2019re recommending is that people really focus on the long term and do the best they can to try to course-correct and get back on track,\u201d says Amin Dabit, a Personal Capital CFP\u00ae.\nMethodology\nWe surveyed 1,002 people who reported currently having a retirement plan. Respondents were 59.7% men and 40.3% women. One respondent chose not to disclose their gender. The average age of respondents was 44 with a standard deviation of 14.1.\nRespondents were asked to report whether they currently practice particular retirement savings habits. This was asked as a check-all-that-apply question. Therefore, percentages won\u2019t add to 100. The same was done when asking respondents about additional financial actions they\u2019ve taken since the COVID-19 pandemic, such as starting a side hustle or transitioning to self-employment.\nWhen asked about specific actions they had taken regarding their retirement savings since the pandemic, respondents were given the following options:\n\nI have done this\nI have considered this but not actually done it\nI haven\u2019t done this\n\nWhen asked about how they would\u2019ve changed their retirement savings strategy in hindsight, people were given the following scale of options:\n\nMuch more conservative\nMore conservative\nNo change\nMore aggressive\nMuch more aggressive\n\nIn our final visualization of the data, these were combined into three groups: more conservatively, no change, and more aggressively.\nLimitations\nThe data we are presenting rely on self-report. There are many issues with self-reported data. These issues include, but are not limited to, the following: selective memory, telescoping, attribution, and exaggeration.\nFair Use Statement\nWhether retirement is right around the corner or decades away, it\u2019s natural to worry about the state of your retirement savings.

            "content": "Despite advancements in gender parity, corporate America still has plenty of work to do. Women are paid 82 cents for every dollar a man earns, putting them at a disadvantage in terms of savings and retirement preparedness. While closing the gender wage gap is important, how much women are paid is only part of the overall issue.\nFrom the beginning of their careers, women face greater challenges to career advancement and wealth accumulation than men. They\u2019re more likely to be underestimated and have their work undervalued \u2013 as evidenced by the pay gap \u2013 leading them to be denied promotions and raises more often than men. And when women do try to speak up in their own defense, they\u2019re often labeled as \u201cbossy\u201d or \u201ctoo aggressive.\u201d\n\u201cIt can be harder to find advocates,\u201d said Ruzwana Bashir, CEO and founder of Peek.com and one of Personal Capital\u2019s Financial Heroes. \u201cWe see systemic situations and societal issues that we are trying to combat now. As times goes on, we will change expectations and ensure women break through glass ceilings in every industry.\u201d\nTo explore the challenges women face in their careers and how they work to achieve their goals, we surveyed nearly 900 employed Americans, both men and women, and over 100 female entrepreneurs on their experiences in the workforce. We learned a lot about just how much work we have left to do in funding female careers and entrepreneurs, and how each woman can start to take charge of her financial future despite having higher hurdles to overcome. Here\u2019s what we discovered.\nMore than Half of Women Feel They are Disadvantaged in Their Careers Compared to Men\nThe biggest obstacle to career advancement women face isn\u2019t in reaching the top rung of the ladder; it\u2019s in making it up that first step to manager. Women account for nearly half of the entry-level workforce but rapidly dwindle to barely one-fifth of the C-suite.\n\nWhen asked how hopeful they are in their career advancement opportunities, over 50% of women said they were only somewhat, slightly, or not at all hopeful. Only 18% said they were extremely hopeful about their future career advancement opportunities. It\u2019s not for lack of ambition: The majority of women would tell you they are very ambitious at work.\nThe crux of the issue is that women often face disadvantages in the workforce. A full 70% agreed that women are disadvantaged in their careers compared to men. From trying to find employment to career advancement, women must scale larger roadblocks than men. Women have a harder time finding employment and often end up in more vulnerable jobs with shorter hours and fewer benefits. Around 14% of women also reported not being paid what they are worth.\nThis results in some startling differences between women\u2019s retirement preparedness relative to men\u2019s. Women are less likely than men to contribute to their 401(k) plan or believe they will ever earn enough to make the maximum contribution. Fewer women are at least somewhat confident they can save enough for retirement \u2013 a scary prospect given 55% of women expect to retire before they reach the Social Security retirement age. All of this points to the fact that women are more likely to need to take bigger withdrawals from their smaller savings earlier in their retirement years, which can greatly handicap their savings\u2019 future growth potential.\nWomen Are Less Likely Than Men to Get Promotions and Raises\nAccess to promotions and raises is a key component of income growth throughout your career, but women continue to fall behind men in career advancement \u2013 and it\u2019s not because women aren\u2019t asking for opportunities and raises. Women ask for raises as often as men, they\u2019re just less likely to receive them.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of women reported asking for, and being denied, a raise or promotion at some point in their careers. Some research points to the fact that women tend to be harder on themselves during evaluation time, referred to as the \u201cgender gap in self-promotion.\u201d Women are less inclined to toot their own horn, so to speak, during annual reviews, which can make them seem like less suitable candidates than their male counterparts.\nThis stagnation results in women having their salaries peak over a decade earlier and over $34,000 lower than men, on average. This wealth gap is only exacerbated by the fact that women are also investing less than men, which prevents their savings from growing as much as they otherwise could.\nWomen Face Microaggressions at Work\nUnequal opportunities and pay are only one side of the career battle women face. Within the workforce, women are confronted with numerous microaggressions. From being told to smile more or appear more pleasant \u2013 the most common microaggression experienced by women at work \u2013 to feeling pressure to distance themselves from their gender, women are often stigmatized at work.\n\nAlmost 40% of women reported being underestimated, such as having a female doctor mistaken for a nurse. Almost two-thirds of women say they\u2019ve been assigned an administrative or clerical task outside of their job description. Over 1 in 5 women have had a male colleague take credit for their work.\nWhen women try to stand up for themselves, they are more likely than men to be labeled as bossy. But when they don\u2019t speak up, they can be told they should be more aggressive. In fact, more women reported being told to be more aggressive than being called bossy or aggressive at work.\nThese microaggressions aren\u2019t only coming from men. While almost all women said they feel supported by their female co-workers, two-thirds also reported being bullied by a female boss. Theories behind the behavior of women not supporting other women include findings that suggest women in higher leadership roles tend to display more male-specific emotional IQ traits, leading them to value relationships less and have lower empathy.\nIt\u2019s also theorized that since women are promoted less, there\u2019s a sense that there are fewer spots available higher up the ladder. This prompts female leaders to feel less inclined to help other women rise in the ranks.\nOver 9 out of 10 Women Experienced Retaliation for Bringing Up the Gender Pay Gap at Work\nWomen are increasingly speaking out about the inequalities they experience at work. Almost half of the women we surveyed said they\u2019ve addressed the gender pay gap at work \u2013 but over 9 in 10 of these women said they experienced some form of retaliation as a result of it.\n\nThe fear of retaliation is one primary reason women don\u2019t speak up about the gender wage gap. Over half of women who haven\u2019t addressed the issue at work said they stayed silent because they were afraid speaking up would jeopardize future advancement opportunities. Around 40% of women said they didn\u2019t have enough concrete information.\nGovernments and experts are increasingly encouraging companies to disclose their wage data. Research by Cornell University found that simple disclosure can shrink the gender pay gap by 7%. Unfortunately, this gap shrank because the companies tended to slow men\u2019s wage gap growth, not because they increased women\u2019s wages. But the fact remains that if people don\u2019t speak up about the wage gap, change cannot be made.\nSpeaking up needn\u2019t be a negative experience \u2013 in fact the majority of women who spoke up about the gender pay gap told us it was an overall positive experience. Only 16% said their experience was negative or extremely negative, and one-quarter of women felt neutral about the experience. So don\u2019t listen to the friends and colleagues who warn you against saying anything (13% of women cited this as the reason they hadn\u2019t spoken up).\nWomen Are Less Likely to Be Saving for Retirement\nCareer development and growth doesn\u2019t just impact the here and now. How people fare in their careers often determines what kind of retirement they can expect. In an Empower Retirement survey of more than 2,000 Americans, 83% of men reported that they\u2019re currently saving for retirement, compared to just 74% of women.\n\nWhen assessing barriers to bolstering retirement savings, both men and women most commonly cited the need to make ends meet. However, there was a 10-percentage-point difference between the number of men and the number of women saying they had to forgo retirement savings to pay the bills (28% compared to 38%). Even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, wage growth lagged behind expectations, decreasing Americans\u2019 purchasing power. People\u2019s salaries were increasing, but not enough to keep pace with cost-of-living increases and inflation.\nFor women, the second most common impediment to saving for retirement was paying off debt other than student loans (though women also were more likely than men to cite student loan debt as a reason for putting off retirement saving). There could be a number of reasons why women were more likely to cite debt obligations than men. For one, the pay gap means women are typically making less than men in similar positions, potentially making any debt harder to pay off in the long run.\nWomen Have Less Access to Workplace Benefits Than Men, on Average\nHow much you are paid is only one contributing element to your overall wealth. Workplace benefits can also have a major impact on your wealth. Over two-thirds of all personal bankruptcies are tied to medical issues. If the recent pandemic has taught us anything, it is the potentially bankrupting cost of medical bills. Uninsured Americans hospitalized for COVID-19 could face medical bills of up to $75,000. And health insurance is only one of the many workplace benefits that can impact an individual\u2019s overall income.\n\nWhile both men and women tended to participate in workplace benefits programs equally, when available, men were more likely to have access to such programs. Around 85% of men said they had workplace perks programs, compared to 75% of women.\nThe biggest divide was in the availability of company-sponsored child care. Only 19% of men said they didn\u2019t have access to this perk, while one-third of women were not given it. This can leave women in a tight spot: Either they pay for child care out of pocket, something which can cost more than in-state college tuition, or they may have to reduce their hours or leave the workforce all together to care for their children themselves. Both of these options can leave women disadvantaged in terms of career and income.\nMany women who leave the workforce to raise children lose the income and retirement savings opportunities they would have had if they\u2019d stayed. And upon returning, they face even more obstacles to career advancement.\nWomen Are Increasingly Choosing to Become Entrepreneurs\nOne way to step away from workplace biases and microaggressions is to be your own boss, though women still face many challenges as entrepreneurs. Funding for female founders, for instance, has historically raised just 2.2 percent of all venture capital dollars.\n\u201cThere are definitely issues with access to capital and in boardrooms,\u201d Bashir said. \u201cThey think that we have different expectations than men, and that really compounds in making it harder for women entrepreneurs and CEOs to raise capital.\u201d Bashir recalls one meeting when she was recommended to not wear a dress, as it wouldn\u2019t align with investors\u2019 vision of an entrepreneur.\nThe tides are changing, however. Over the past two decades, the number of women-owned businesses has grown at a rate of around 849 new women-owned businesses every day. Our data suggests this trend is not slowing down.\n\nOver one-quarter of the female entrepreneurs surveyed for this report said they started their business less than one year ago. For over 1 in 5, their business is less than six months old. Among these new entrepreneurs, around half of the women said they started their own business because of COVID-19.\nNearly 75% of female entrepreneurs said they are satisfied with their career, even though the majority noted earning $35,000 or less per year. The vast majority of female entrepreneurs didn\u2019t start their business because they needed to; their career choice was one of desire.\nWhile women are by and large reporting career satisfaction as entrepreneurs, less than half had any mentorship to help them get there. Among those who were mentored, over three-quarters of them had a female mentor, proving some women are supporting other women in business.\nBashir has found great value in peer mentorship, whether discussing the challenges of competing with larger enterprises or dealing with the ramifications of COVID-19.\n\u201cPeer mentorship with other people who are in a similar position allows you to be vulnerable and honest,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are not having to worry that that person is potentially someone you are going to heavily rely on in your career. For me, it has been a huge way for me to learn.\u201d\nFunding Your Own Future\nIt can feel like the deck is stacked against women in corporate America. From a pay gap that leaves women earning 82 cents for every dollar a man earns to microaggressions and discrimination in the workplace, women have a lot to overcome. This doesn\u2019t mean all is lost, however. While how much you are paid may be largely out of your hands, what you do with the money you earn is entirely in your control.\n\u201cFinancial empowerment is having a trajectory, a plan that will get you where you want to be in the future,\u201d Bashir told us. \u201cAs opposed to something that you feel you can\u2019t control or that\u2019s overwhelming, it becomes one of your goals that you work toward.\u201d\nA great way to take control over your money is to know where you stand. How much do you spend every month? What does your cash flow look like? How are your investments performing? Are you paying too much in fees? How prepared are you for retirement?

Theories behind the behavior of women not supporting other women include findings that suggest women in higher leadership roles tend to display <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2020/01/21/why-women-dont-always-support-other-women/#2969069f3b05\">more male-specific emotional IQ traits,</a> leading them to value relationships less and have lower empathy.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also theorized that since women are promoted less, there\u2019s a sense that there are fewer spots available higher up the ladder. This prompts female leaders to feel <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2019/11/21/leadership-gender-and-the-power-of-in-group-bias/#3b3ec30216d7\">less inclined to help other women</a> rise in the ranks.</p>\n<h2>Over 9 out of 10 Women Experienced Retaliation for Bringing Up the Gender Pay Gap at Work</h2>\n<p>Women are increasingly speaking out about the inequalities they experience at work. Almost half of the women we surveyed said they\u2019ve addressed the gender pay gap at work \u2013 but over 9 in 10 of these women said they experienced some form of retaliation as a result of it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-51444 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset4-201x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"657\" height=\"980\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset4-201x300.png 201w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset4-319x476.png 319w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset4-768x1145.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset4.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px\" /></p>\n<p>The fear of retaliation is one primary reason women don\u2019t speak up about the gender wage gap. Over half of women who haven\u2019t addressed the issue at work said they stayed silent because they were afraid speaking up would jeopardize future advancement opportunities. Around 40% of women said they didn\u2019t have enough concrete information.</p>\n<p>Governments and experts are increasingly encouraging companies to disclose their wage data. Research by Cornell University found that simple disclosure can <a href=\"https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/02/gender-pay-gap-shrinks-when-companies-disclose-wages\">shrink the gender pay gap by 7%</a>. Unfortunately, this gap shrank because the companies tended to slow men\u2019s wage gap growth, not because they increased women\u2019s wages. But the fact remains that if people don\u2019t speak up about the wage gap, change cannot be made.</p>\n<p>Speaking up needn\u2019t be a negative experience \u2013 in fact the majority of women who spoke up about the gender pay gap told us it was an overall positive experience. Only 16% said their experience was negative or extremely negative, and one-quarter of women felt neutral about the experience. So don\u2019t listen to the friends and colleagues who warn you against saying anything (13% of women cited this as the reason they hadn\u2019t spoken up).</p>\n<h2>Women Are Less Likely to Be Saving for Retirement</h2>\n<p>Career development and growth doesn\u2019t just impact the here and now. How people fare in their careers often determines what kind of retirement they can expect. In an Empower Retirement survey of more than 2,000 Americans, 83% of men reported that they\u2019re currently saving for retirement, compared to just 74% of women.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-51445 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset7-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset7-1.png 800w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset7-1-121x300.png 121w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset7-1-191x476.png 191w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset7-1-768x1909.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset7-1-618x1536.png 618w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>When assessing barriers to bolstering retirement savings, both men and women most commonly cited the need to make ends meet. However, there was a 10-percentage-point difference between the number of men and the number of women saying they had to forgo retirement savings to pay the bills (28% compared to 38%). Even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/\">wage growth lagged behind expectations</a>, decreasing Americans\u2019 purchasing power. People\u2019s salaries were increasing, but not enough to keep pace with cost-of-living increases and inflation.</p>\n<p>For women, the second most common impediment to saving for retirement was paying off debt other than student loans (though women also were more likely than men to cite student loan debt as a reason for putting off retirement saving). There could be a number of reasons why women were more likely to cite debt obligations than men. For one, the pay gap means women are typically making less than men in similar positions, potentially making any debt harder to pay off in the long run.</p>\n<h2>Women Have Less Access to Workplace Benefits Than Men, on Average</h2>\n<p>How much you are paid is only one contributing element to your overall wealth. Workplace benefits can also have a major impact on your wealth. Over <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/11/this-is-the-real-reason-most-americans-file-for-bankruptcy.html\">two-thirds of all personal bankruptcies</a> are tied to medical issues. If the recent pandemic has taught us anything, it is the potentially bankrupting cost of medical bills. Uninsured Americans hospitalized for COVID-19 could face medical bills <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/01/covid-19-hospital-bills-could-cost-uninsured-americans-up-to-75000.html\">of up to $75,000</a>. And health insurance is only one of the many workplace benefits that can impact an individual\u2019s overall income.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-51446 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset5-194x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"658\" height=\"1018\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset5-194x300.png 194w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset5-308x476.png 308w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset5-768x1188.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset5.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" /></p>\n<p>While both men and women tended to participate in workplace benefits programs equally, when available, men were more likely to have access to such programs. Around 85% of men said they had workplace perks programs, compared to 75% of women.</p>\n<p>The biggest divide was in the availability of company-sponsored child care. Only 19% of men said they didn\u2019t have access to this perk, while one-third of women were not given it. This can leave women in a tight spot: Either they pay for child care out of pocket, something which can cost <a href=\"https://www.care.com/c/stories/2423/how-much-does-child-care-cost/\">more than in-state college tuition</a>, or they may have to reduce their hours or leave the workforce all together to care for their children themselves. Both of these options can leave women disadvantaged in terms of career and income.</p>\n<p>Many women who leave the workforce to raise children lose the income and retirement savings opportunities they would have had if they\u2019d stayed. And upon returning, they <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2020/03/nearly-half-of-working-moms-take-a-career-break.html?page=all#:~:text=The%20poll%20of%203%2C000%20working,their%20financial%20situation%20prevented%20it.\">face even more obstacles</a> to career advancement.</p>\n<h2>Women Are Increasingly Choosing to Become Entrepreneurs</h2>\n<p>One way to step away from workplace biases and microaggressions is to be your own boss, though women still face many challenges as entrepreneurs. Funding for female founders, for instance, has historically raised just 2.2 percent of all venture capital dollars.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are definitely issues with access to capital and in boardrooms,\u201d Bashir said. \u201cThey think that we have different expectations than men, and that really compounds in making it harder for women entrepreneurs and CEOs to raise capital.\u201d Bashir recalls one meeting when she was recommended to not wear a dress, as it wouldn\u2019t align with investors\u2019 vision of an entrepreneur.</p>\n<p>The tides are changing, however. Over the past two decades, the number of women-owned businesses has grown at a rate of around <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/426157-women-entrepreneurs-are-on-the-rise-lets-continue-the-trend\">849 new women-owned businesses every day</a>. Our data suggests this trend is not slowing down.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-51447 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset6-187x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"1107\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset6-187x300.png 187w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset6-297x476.png 297w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset6-768x1233.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/asset6.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></p>\n<p>Over one-quarter of the female entrepreneurs surveyed for this report said they started their business less than one year ago. For over 1 in 5, their business is less than six months old. Among these new entrepreneurs, around half of the women said they started their own business because of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Nearly 75% of female entrepreneurs said they are satisfied with their career, even though the majority noted earning $35,000 or less per year. The vast majority of female entrepreneurs didn\u2019t start their business because they needed to; their career choice was one of desire.</p>\n<p>While women are by and large reporting career satisfaction as entrepreneurs, less than half had any mentorship to help them get there. Among those who were mentored, over three-quarters of them had a female mentor, proving some women are supporting other women in business.</p>\n<p>Bashir has found great value in peer mentorship, whether discussing the challenges of competing with larger enterprises or dealing with the ramifications of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeer mentorship with other people who are in a similar position allows you to be vulnerable and honest,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are not having to worry that that person is potentially someone you are going to heavily rely on in your career. For me, it has been a huge way for me to learn.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Funding Your Own Future</h2>\n<p>It can feel like the deck is stacked against women in corporate America. From a pay gap that leaves women earning 82 cents for every dollar a man earns to microaggressions and discrimination in the workplace, women have a lot to overcome. This doesn\u2019t mean all is lost, however. While how much you are paid may be largely out of your hands, what you do with the money you earn is entirely in your control.</p>\n<p>\u201cFinancial empowerment is having a trajectory, a plan that will get you where you want to be in the future,\u201d Bashir told us. \u201cAs opposed to something that you feel you can\u2019t control or that\u2019s overwhelming, it becomes one of your goals that you work toward.\u201d</p>\n<p>A great way to take control over your money is to know where you stand. How much do you spend every month? What does your cash flow look like? How are your investments performing? Are you paying too much in fees? How prepared are you for retirement?

The impact of COVID-19 and other major stories in the spotlight such as protests and social unrest have changed many of our lives and forced us to re-think our values. So, we were interested: how do our evolving values impact the way we spend and invest our money?\nFor a closer look, we surveyed 1,000 Americans on how they decide where to spend, donate, or invest their money. \nAre Americans Stopping Spending Based on Their Social or Political Beliefs?\n\nA majority of those surveyed have altered their spending habits based on businesses\u2019 political and social stances. Sixty percent of respondents have stopped spending money at businesses they disagree with, and 75% of those have posted on social media about their decision.\nAccording to the survey, Republicans (67%) were the most likely to stop spending money at a business due to their social or political positions, followed by 59% of Democrats and 49% of Independent voters.\nMost commonly, respondents decided to stop spending money with businesses based on their approach to COVID-19 precautions (57%), their view on face masks (44%), and their opinion on the Black Lives Matter movement (44%). \nWhile face mask mandates vary from state to state, some retailers require customers to wear masks (and some decide to waive mask requirements) to shop in their stores regardless of local legislation. Twenty-nine percent of people deciding to break up with a retailer over their political or social positions said they would never shop in those stores again.\nSupporting New Businesses Based on Social and Political Affiliations\n\nBlack-owned businesses (which have historically struggled to qualify for small business loans) have seen rapidly increasing sales over recent weeks. In addition to activists circulating lists of business owners and shops that allies can buy from to support Black communities, one leader urged Americans to spend $5 million at Black-owned businesses between June and July.\nFifty-nine percent of respondents have started to support new businesses since March 2020, 75% of whom have posted on social media about the brands they\u2019re supporting. \nFor a majority of respondents, COVID-19 precautions (64%) were the leading motivation to support new businesses, followed by their view on face masks (55%), and their position on the Black Lives Matter movement (45%). \nAre Americans Actively Engaged in Where Their Money is Invested?\nRegardless of their social or political beliefs, not all respondents take an active role in the companies or institutions where they invest their money. Slightly more than half of them (51%) chose the companies they invested in, while 14% left those decisions to their financial advisors.\nCompared to 39% of baby boomers and 47% of Gen Xers, 55% of millennials said they select the companies they want to invest in. In contrast, older generations \u2014 including 23% of baby boomers \u2014 were more likely to work with a broker or financial advisor. \nRegarding political affiliation, Independent respondents and Republicans (54% and 53%, respectively) were more likely than Democrats (47%) to pick the companies they invest in.\nAre Americans \u201cVoting With Their Wallets\u201d More Since March 2020?\nThe concept of \u201cvoting with your wallet\u201d is nothing new. Supporting companies whose social positions align with your own can be an extension of political or social engagement in the same way that boycotting companies you don\u2019t agree with can make a statement.\n\nSince March 2020, more than 1 in 4 respondents (27%) have decided to sell their stocks due to a company\u2019s behavior, including 29% of millennials and 25% of Gen Xers. \nWhile 46% of people acknowledged paying the same level of attention to companies\u2019 social stances when purchasing stocks, 39% of respondents said they pay closer attention to those positions.\nOf course, many Americans are as invested in what companies say about social matters as what they do, which don\u2019t always align. Millennials were the most likely generation (41%) to pay closer attention to companies\u2019 stances and actions.\nMoney Over Social Matters?\nWhen asked about social stances and their investment portfolios, 52% of respondents said they prefer to invest in companies they agree with on social issues and make less money. Women (60%) were more inclined than men (47%) to make less money by investing in companies they agree with socially.\n\nFocusing on Socially Responsible Investing\n\nA majority of respondents (64%) indicated they practice socially responsible investing. Baby boomers (51%) were the least likely to consider social causes when making decisions about their investments, followed by 62% Generation Xers and 68% of millennials.\nAccording to the survey, the most common criteria for making socially responsible investment decisions included understanding what percentage of profits a company donates (50%) and the percentage of minorities on the board of directors (45%). \nBaby boomers were the most likely generation to consider the percentage of profits a company donates.\nHow Americans Are Giving to Worthy Causes in 2020\nGiven the current political and social climate, 26% of respondents have pulled money out of their savings account to donate to charitable causes since March, and 31% of people donated to organizations for the first time. Sixty-nine percent of those supporting an organization for the first time since March expected to continue donating to those causes.\n\nAmong respondents donating to new organizations since March, 75% contributed to causes related to COVID-19, and 48% gave money to the Black Lives Matter movement or other racial justice causes. \nMillennials were the most likely generation to donate to COVID-19-related organizations (74%). Baby boomers were the least likely generation to donate to Black Lives Matter and Social Justice March 2020.\nMaking Decisions About Your Money\nNot unlike how many people spend their money, a majority of respondents considered themselves socially responsible investors. Among those who took a more active role in their investment decisions, a company\u2019s hiring practices, diversity of directors, and donation history were important considerations when deciding whether to invest in their brand.\nAt Personal Capital, we make sure you have access to all of your accounts in one place so that you can actively monitor your investments, identify and reduce hidden fees, and plan for the future.

In this second study, we had 1,014 respondents. These respondents had an average age of 37.5, with a standard deviation of 12.1.

Twenty-nine percent of people deciding to break up with a retailer over their political or social positions said they would never shop in those stores again.</p>\n<h2>Supporting New Businesses Based on Social and Political Affiliations</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-51192 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a2-198x300.png\" alt=\"spending at new businesses\" width=\"659\" height=\"998\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a2-198x300.png 198w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a2-314x476.png 314w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a2-768x1164.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a2.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" /></p>\n<p>Black-owned businesses (which have historically struggled to qualify for small business loans) have seen rapidly increasing sales over recent weeks. In addition to activists circulating lists of business owners and shops that allies can buy from to support Black communities, one leader urged Americans to spend $5 million at Black-owned businesses between June and July.</p>\n<p><strong>Fifty-nine percent of respondents have started to support new businesses since March 2020, 75% of whom have posted on social media about the brands they\u2019re supporting. </strong></p>\n<p>For a majority of respondents, <strong>COVID-19 precautions (64%) were the leading motivation to support new businesses, followed by their view on face masks (55%), and their position on the Black Lives Matter movement (45%). </strong></p>\n<h2>Are Americans Actively Engaged in Where Their Money is Invested?</h2>\n<p>Regardless of their social or political beliefs, not all respondents take an active role in the companies or institutions where they invest their money. Slightly more than half of them (51%) chose the companies they invested in, while 14% left those decisions to their financial advisors.</p>\n<p><strong>Compared to 39% of baby boomers and 47% of Gen Xers, 55% of millennials said they select the companies they want to invest in. In contrast, older generations \u2014 including 23% of baby boomers \u2014 were more likely to work with a broker or financial advisor. </strong></p>\n<p>Regarding political affiliation, Independent respondents and Republicans (54% and 53%, respectively) were more likely than Democrats (47%) to pick the companies they invest in.</p>\n<h2>Are Americans \u201cVoting With Their Wallets\u201d More Since March 2020?</h2>\n<p>The concept of \u201cvoting with your wallet\u201d is nothing new. Supporting companies whose social positions align with your own can be an extension of political or social engagement in the same way that boycotting companies you don\u2019t agree with can make a statement.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-51194 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a4-272x300.png\" alt=\"voting with your wallet\" width=\"821\" height=\"906\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a4-272x300.png 272w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a4-431x476.png 431w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a4-768x848.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a4.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 821px) 100vw, 821px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Since March 2020, more than 1 in 4 respondents (27%) have decided to sell their stocks due to a company\u2019s behavior, including 29% of millennials and 25% of Gen Xers. </strong></p>\n<p>While 46% of people acknowledged paying the same level of attention to companies\u2019 social stances when purchasing stocks, 39% of respondents said they pay closer attention to those positions.</p>\n<p>Of course, many Americans are as invested in what companies say about social matters as what they do, which don\u2019t always align. Millennials were the most likely generation (41%) to pay closer attention to companies\u2019 stances and actions.</p>\n<h2>Money Over Social Matters?</h2>\n<p>When asked about social stances and their investment portfolios, 52% of respondents said they prefer to invest in companies they agree with on social issues and make less money. Women (60%) were more inclined than men (47%) to make less money by investing in companies they agree with socially.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-51195 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a5-300x215.png\" alt=\"money over social matters\" width=\"876\" height=\"628\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a5-300x215.png 300w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a5-665x476.png 665w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a5-768x550.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a5.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" /></p>\n<h2>Focusing on Socially Responsible Investing</h2>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-51196 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a6.png\" alt=\"socially responsible investing\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a6.png 800w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a6-130x300.png 130w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a6-206x476.png 206w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a6-768x1779.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a6-663x1536.png 663w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>A majority of respondents (64%) indicated they practice socially responsible investing. Baby boomers (51%) were the least likely to consider social causes when making decisions about their investments, followed by 62% Generation Xers and 68% of millennials.</p>\n<p><strong>According to the survey, the most common criteria for making socially responsible investment decisions included understanding what percentage of profits a company donates (50%) and the percentage of minorities on the board of directors (45%). </strong></p>\n<p>Baby boomers were the most likely generation to consider the percentage of profits a company donates.</p>\n<h2>How Americans Are Giving to Worthy Causes in 2020</h2>\n<p>Given the current political and social climate, 26% of respondents have pulled money out of their savings account to donate to charitable causes since March, and 31% of people donated to organizations for the first time. Sixty-nine percent of those supporting an organization for the first time since March expected to continue donating to those causes.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-51197 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a7.png\" alt=\"charitable giving\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a7.png 800w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a7-165x300.png 165w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a7-262x476.png 262w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a7-768x1394.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Among respondents donating to new organizations since March, 75% contributed to causes related to COVID-19, and 48% gave money to the Black Lives Matter movement or other racial justice causes. </strong></p>\n<p>Millennials were the most likely generation to donate to COVID-19-related organizations (74%). Baby boomers were the least likely generation to donate to Black Lives Matter and Social Justice March 2020.</p>\n<h2>Making Decisions About Your Money</h2>\n<p>Not unlike how many people spend their money, a majority of respondents considered themselves socially responsible investors. Among those who took a more active role in their investment decisions, a company\u2019s hiring practices, diversity of directors, and donation history were important considerations when deciding whether to invest in their brand.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/sign-up/simple-with-benefits\"><strong><u>Personal Capital</u></strong></a>, we make sure you have access to all of your <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/link-your-account#intro\">accounts in one place</a> so that you can actively monitor your investments, identify and reduce hidden fees, and plan for the future.

            "content": "When shelter-in-place and lockdown orders seemed like they would be a passing moment in time, it may have been easy to dismiss the idea of long-term changes to our everyday way of living. The \u201cnew normal,\u201d as it has been regularly referred to, was (hopefully) something that would come and go with the passing of COVID-19.\nSeveral months later, it\u2019s clear that adapting to the new normal is simply something we all have to get used to. Many companies don\u2019t plan to return to their offices in full until 2021 (if at all), dining out is something that continues to happen with less and less frequency, and social distancing is now a part of everyday consideration. For millions of Americans, there\u2019s another aspect of life they\u2019ll be missing out on in 2020: professional sports.\nSome leagues (like the NBA) have managed to actively institute policies designed to isolate players from any unnecessary threat of contracting COVID-19. At the time of this writing, several NFL teams have announced their plans to play through the season with no fans in attendance. The end result is clear \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky enough to see your sport of choice return in 2020, this will be an asterisk year at best.\nAnd while they may not have any say in the matter, we asked nearly 1,000 sports fans a simple question: How much money would you pay to see a game this year? Let\u2019s take a closer look at what they had to say, which leagues and teams seem to be worth the most to fans, and what fans are planning to do to get their sports fix.\nAre You Ready for Some Football?\n\nIf Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, has any say in what happens during the 2020 NFL season, his team will be playing in front of a packed crowd in AT&T Stadium. Unlike the position held by most NFL teams about how to navigate football in the midst of a global health pandemic, Jones clearly stated in August that while he plans on bringing fans back safely, he expects to fill as many of the 40,000 available seats in the stadium as possible.\nWhen asked how much money they would hypothetically be willing to spend to see a full season (with or without fans in seats), nearly 44% of NFL fans weren\u2019t willing to spend a dime. With renewed attention being paid to the subject of kneeling during the national anthem in support of Black Lives Matter protests, some fans have announced plans to boycott the NFL entirely. Among those offering to put their money where their passion for football is, fans indicated they would be willing to pay $156 a month to watch football games being played without fans in stadiums, and $191 for games with fans in attendance.\nMore than half of NFL fans surveyed admitted they were even willing to contract COVID-19 in order to watch a game in person. Including the 76% of fans of the Carolina Panthers, more than 70% of fans of the Indianapolis Colts (75%), Baltimore Ravens (73%), and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (73%) said the same. Just 21% of NFL fans indicated they would purchase the seat next to them to ensure social distancing if they were allowed to attend a game in person in 2020.\nBasketball During COVID-19\n\nIn a completely unprecedented move, the NBA resumed its season in 2020 by inviting players, staff, and coaches to live and play in a single location: Disney World. Referred to as the \u201cNBA bubble,\u201d the idea was to keep teams isolated from outside factors by inviting them to live in Disney World hotels, play games in Disney facilities, and simply exist within the confines of the Happiest Bubble on Earth.\nWhile 47% of NBA fans weren\u2019t willing to pay to see their teams play in 2020, those surveyed indicated seeing real fans in attendance would be worth $135 a month, on average. Fans of the Portland Trail Blazers (63%), Los Angeles Lakers (62%), and Charlotte Hornets (61%) were the most likely to indicate willing to pay to attend a game in person.\nFifty-nine percent of NBA fans were willing to take the risk of contracting COVID-19 in order to see their favorite teams play, but just 16% were willing to pay for an extra seat to help ensure they weren\u2019t sitting next to someone else while in attendance. Fans of the Phoenix Suns (79%), Portland Trail Blazers, and Charlotte Hornets (78% each) were the most likely to indicate they were comfortable taking a chance on getting COVID-19 if it meant getting to see a game in person.\nReady to Play Ball\n\nFor Major League Baseball, only one time prior to the 2020 season had a game ever been played without fans in attendance. In 2015, the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago White Sox played a fan-free game at Camden Yards following protests after the death of Freddie Gray. In 2020, by some estimations, the viewing experience isn\u2019t diminished without real-life attendees in the stands.\nWhile more than 44% of MLB fans weren\u2019t willing to pay anything to see the season continue (with or without fans), those surveyed indicated they were willing to spend $146 a month, on average, to see the season continue with fans in seats. Another 56% of fans were willing to pay $141, on average, to attend the otherwise empty games in person, including 69% of both Los Angeles Dodgers fans and New York Yankees fans.\nCompared to the NBA and the NFL, more fans (60%) were willing to take a chance that they might contract COVID-19 in order to attend a game in person. Fan bases most willing to take a chance on contracting the disease were the Washington Nationals (76%), Los Angeles Angels (75%), and Texas Rangers (71%). Among the 16% of fans who would be interested in purchasing an empty seat next to them at a game to ensure social distancing, fans were willing to pay $141, on average.\nA Change of Plans\n\nFor some fans missing out on the opportunity to watch their teams play in person, the disappointment runs all the way down to their wallets. Fifty-seven percent of people surveyed indicated being season ticket holders for at least one professional sports team including the NBA (64%), NFL (44%), and MLB (40%).\nFor at least 75% of season ticket holders polled, the 2020 season resulted in at least a partial refund of their tickets. Eighty-two percent of season ticket holders of both NFL and NHL tickets indicated having gotten money back for the 2020 season. While the price of season tickets varies from league to league and from team to team, 45% of fans getting a refund indicated putting that money into savings, followed by those who invested it (39%) and spent it on other sports-related purchases (37%).\nMaking Do at Home\n\nIt may be fun to fantasize about how much money you would spend to see sports return to some sense of normalcy in 2020. Getting to go to a game, weekly tailgating rituals, and even just being around fellow fans are unlikely to take place for sports fans this year, no matter how much they are willing to pay.\nInstead, we asked fans what the \u201cnew normal\u201d means for getting their sports fix. Forty percent of respondents indicated paying for a TV viewing package (like the NFL Sunday Ticket) in order to watch games, and another 39% upgraded their existing packages to include more options or games. Given the virtual nature of viewing, 38% of fans said they upgraded their at-home internet to accommodate viewing, and 35% purchased a newer or upgraded TV. Among the 20% of sports fans who purchased or upgraded their home entertainment sound system to enjoy sports from home, the average expense was $147.\nA New Normal for Sports\nNo matter how much money fans are willing to pay (or how willing they are to risk contracting COVID-19 in the process), attending a live sporting event in 2020 likely isn\u2019t in the cards. As many leagues and teams make sweeping changes to protect players and team staff from the disease, fans have to consider what their at-home options might be. For some, that\u2019s included upgrading to new or even better TVs and sound systems.\nWith the money you got back from refunded season tickets or with the cash you\u2019re saving by not attending games or tailgating, now could be the perfect time to consider opening a Personal Capital Cash account. With the added benefit of high FDIC insurance, a Personal Capital Cash account also gives you flexible deposits and withdrawals.

Fans were defined as watching at least three games per season for each league as well as identifying the teams they were fans of. All numerical values were based on a minimum of 1 and the maximum values were capped at the 95th percentile. Within our study, we had 670 NFL fans, 823 MLB fans, and 836 NBA fans. Our respondents\u2019 average age was 36.9 with a standard deviation of 11.77. 663 men and 320 women completed our study. There are some limits to the data explored above.

Unlike the position held by most NFL teams about how to navigate football in the midst of a global health pandemic, Jones <a href=\"https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2020/8/12/21365584/dallas-cowboys-fans-stadiums-coronavirus\">clearly stated in August </a>that while he plans on bringing fans back safely, he expects to fill as many of the 40,000 available seats in the stadium as possible.</p>\n<p>When asked how much money they would hypothetically be willing to spend to see a full season (with or without fans in seats), <strong>nearly 44% of NFL fans weren\u2019t willing to spend a dime</strong>. With renewed attention being paid to the subject of kneeling during the national anthem in support of Black Lives Matter protests, some fans have announced plans to <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/map-usa-states-boycotting-nfl-kneeling-kaepernick-anthem-2020-6\">boycott the NFL</a> entirely. <strong>Among those offering to put their money where their passion for football is, fans indicated they would be willing to pay $156 a month to watch football games being played without fans in stadiums, and $191 for games with fans in attendance.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>More than half of NFL fans surveyed admitted they were even willing to contract COVID-19 in order to watch a game in person.</strong> Including the 76% of fans of the Carolina Panthers, more than 70% of fans of the Indianapolis Colts (75%), Baltimore Ravens (73%), and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (73%) said the same. Just 21% of NFL fans indicated they would purchase the seat next to them to ensure social distancing if they were allowed to attend a game in person in 2020.</p>\n<h2>Basketball During COVID-19</h2>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-51327 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset2.png\" alt=\"nba fans spending\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset2.png 800w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset2-136x300.png 136w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset2-216x476.png 216w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset2-768x1690.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset2-698x1536.png 698w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><br />\nIn a completely unprecedented move, the NBA resumed its season in 2020 by inviting players, staff, and coaches to live and play in a single location: Disney World. Referred to as the \u201cNBA bubble,\u201d the idea was to keep teams isolated from outside factors by inviting them to live in Disney World hotels, play games in Disney facilities, and simply exist within the confines of the Happiest Bubble on Earth.</p>\n<p>While 47% of NBA fans weren\u2019t willing to pay to see their teams play in 2020, those surveyed indicated seeing real fans in attendance would be worth $135 a month, on average. Fans of the Portland Trail Blazers (63%), Los Angeles Lakers (62%), and Charlotte Hornets (61%) were the most likely to indicate willing to pay to attend a game in person.</p>\n<p><strong>Fifty-nine percent of NBA fans were willing to take the risk of contracting COVID-19 in order to see their favorite teams play, but just 16% were willing to pay for an extra seat to help ensure they weren\u2019t sitting next to someone else while in attendance.</strong> Fans of the Phoenix Suns (79%), Portland Trail Blazers, and Charlotte Hornets (78% each) were the most likely to indicate they were comfortable taking a chance on getting COVID-19 if it meant getting to see a game in person.</p>\n<h2>Ready to Play Ball</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-51328 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset3-134x300.png\" alt=\"mlb fans spending\" width=\"566\" height=\"1267\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset3-134x300.png 134w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset3-213x476.png 213w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset3-768x1719.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset3-686x1536.png 686w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset3.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\" /><br />\nFor Major League Baseball, only one time prior to the 2020 season had a game ever been played without fans in attendance. In 2015, the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago White Sox played a fan-free game at Camden Yards following protests after the death of Freddie Gray. In 2020, by some estimations, the viewing experience isn\u2019t diminished without real-life attendees in the stands.</p>\n<p>While more than 44% of MLB fans weren\u2019t willing to pay anything to see the season continue (with or without fans), those surveyed indicated they were willing to spend $146 a month, on average, to see the season continue with fans in seats. Another 56% of fans were willing to pay $141, on average, to attend the otherwise empty games in person, including 69% of both Los Angeles Dodgers fans and New York Yankees fans.</p>\n<p><strong>Compared to the NBA and the NFL, more fans (60%) were willing to take a chance that they might contract COVID-19 in order to attend a game in person.</strong> Fan bases most willing to take a chance on contracting the disease were the Washington Nationals (76%), Los Angeles Angels (75%), and Texas Rangers (71%). Among the 16% of fans who would be interested in purchasing an empty seat next to them at a game to ensure social distancing, fans were willing to pay $141, on average.</p>\n<h2>A Change of Plans</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-51329 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset4-248x300.png\" alt=\"season ticket holders\" width=\"486\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset4-248x300.png 248w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset4-393x476.png 393w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset4-768x929.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset4.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\" /><br />\nFor some fans missing out on the opportunity to watch their teams play in person, the disappointment runs all the way down to their wallets. Fifty-seven percent of people surveyed indicated being season ticket holders for at least one professional sports team including the NBA (64%), NFL (44%), and MLB (40%).</p>\n<p><strong>For at least 75% of season ticket holders polled, the 2020 season resulted in at least a partial refund of their tickets.</strong> Eighty-two percent of season ticket holders of both NFL and NHL tickets indicated having gotten money back for the 2020 season. While the price of season tickets varies from league to league and from team to team, 45% of fans getting a refund indicated putting that money into savings, followed by those who invested it (39%) and spent it on other sports-related purchases (37%).</p>\n<h2>Making Do at Home</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-51330 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset5-233x300.png\" alt=\"sports spending\" width=\"527\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset5-233x300.png 233w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset5-369x476.png 369w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset5-768x991.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset5-400x516.png 400w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asset5.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px\" /><br />\nIt may be fun to fantasize about how much money you would spend to see sports return to some sense of normalcy in 2020. Getting to go to a game, weekly tailgating rituals, and even just being around fellow fans are unlikely to take place for sports fans this year, no matter how much they are willing to pay.</p>\n<p>Instead, we asked fans what the \u201cnew normal\u201d means for getting their sports fix. Forty percent of respondents indicated paying for a TV viewing package (like the NFL Sunday Ticket) in order to watch games, and another 39% upgraded their existing packages to include more options or games. Given the virtual nature of viewing, 38% of fans said they upgraded their at-home internet to accommodate viewing, and 35% purchased a newer or upgraded TV. Among the 20% of sports fans who purchased or upgraded their home entertainment sound system to enjoy sports from home, the average expense was $147.</p>\n<h2>A New Normal for Sports</h2>\n<p>No matter how much money fans are willing to pay (or how willing they are to risk contracting COVID-19 in the process), attending a live sporting event in 2020 likely isn\u2019t in the cards. As many leagues and teams make sweeping changes to protect players and team staff from the disease, fans have to consider what their at-home options might be. For some, that\u2019s included upgrading to new or even better TVs and sound systems.</p>\n<p>With the money you got back from refunded season tickets or with the cash you\u2019re saving by not attending games or tailgating, now could be the perfect time to consider opening a <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/cash\"><strong><u>Personal Capital Cash account</u></strong></a>.

This type of policy usually comprises an insurance product coupled with a savings or investment component. Your insurance company invests part of your premium and your cash value is then built up by the accrued interest. The growth is generally tax deferred and can be accessed over the life of the policy, with some constraints.\nThese types of policies tend to have larger upfront costs with higher premiums due to the extended coverage period and investment component. Investment choices offered through the policy tend to be high cost and inefficient, which may offset the potential tax benefit.

Your ability to manage finances is critical to determining what your future will look like. One big part of this is figuring out where you should save and how you should spend in retirement.\nWhere Should I Save?\nUnless you inherit or marry money (or win the lottery), there are only two ways to afford retirement: Get a job that offers a good pension, or save and invest.\nAssuming the latter applies to most of us, the next question is: where should you be saving? Generally, the primary choices of accounts and investment vehicles available include tax-advantaged retirement accounts, taxable brokerage accounts, bank accounts, physical property, or paying down debt. With so many potential variables, it\u2019s impossible to offer hard rules that will apply to everyone. However, we generally recommend the following:\n7 Tips to Save Money\n\nPay off any high-interest debt first.\nIf your employer offers any kind of matching contribution to your 401k, then you should save at least up the amount matched.\nIf no employer match is available, you should try to maximize savings in tax-advantaged retirement accounts before saving in taxable accounts. These include accounts like traditional and Roth 401ks and IRAs\nIf you have kids, it usually makes sense to open one or more 529 accounts which cover education-related costs. But only do this if your other tax-advantaged retirement account contributions are maxed out. Remember, you can borrow for school, but you can\u2019t for retirement!\nA primary home can be a wonderful investment \u2013 the leverage of a mortgage and the tax benefits of the interest deduction usually make buying a home a good idea, as long as you can afford it and plan to live in it for at least six years.\nSpeaking of buying a home, we don\u2019t usually recommend paying off your mortgage if you have a rate under 4.5% (unless you have a stock portfolio larger than the value of your home). If you don\u2019t have the stomach for stocks, however, then maintaining a mortgage and simultaneously holding a significant amount of lower yielding cash or bonds is simply throwing money away. In this case, go ahead and pay off the mortgage.\nWhile second homes and rental properties can be good investments, they\u2019re not for everyone; keep in mind that a second property that isn\u2019t rented out should be considered consumption, not an investment.\n\nHow Should I Spend?\nOnce you\u2019re retired, adhering to the right spending level is one of your most important financial responsibilities. Spend too much and you risk running out of money. Spend too little and you will miss out on valuable life experiences. There is a complicated whirl of variables and \u201cwhat if?\u201d scenarios that will have a direct bearing on your spending level.\nQuestions for Retirement\nHere are some good questions to ask yourself when it comes to spending in retirement:\n\nWhen do I want to retire?\nHow long will I live?\nWhat about my spouse?\nHow much will healthcare cost?\nWill I move?\nHow much do I want to leave behind?\n\nYour Withdrawal Rate\nFrom an asset management perspective, the spending question is usually framed in terms of one\u2019s \u201cwithdrawal rate,\u201d which is the amount spent from your investment portfolio each year as a percentage of the total portfolio value. Typically, it is assumed the original withdrawal dollar amount remains constant, except for an annual inflation adjustment.\nYour goal should be to find a withdrawal rate that balances your lifestyle needs with a minimal (or at least acceptable) risk of running out of money. Like many things in life, luck and timing play a big role in your financial success in retirement. These factors may be beyond your control, but regardless of how they play out, it\u2019s up to you to exercise control where you can. Establishing and maintaining a disciplined withdrawal strategy for your retirement will substantially increase your odds of success.\nAn industry rule of thumb \u2013 the 4% Rule \u2013 suggests that balanced portfolios will not run out of money if the withdrawal rate is limited to 4% annually. Withdrawals are not adjusted for market returns. You can perform a rough estimate of your retirement planning position by using this rule.\nDon\u2019t Forget Health Care\nAnother area of spending many people don\u2019t think about is health care. The average couple retiring at 65 will spend about $275,000 on health care over the course of their retirement. These expenses can come in the form of long-term care. Medicaid laws ensure that you will not be thrown out on the street if your assets are depleted because of long-term care costs. In fact, it may be worth planning to make use of this government insurance policy if/when the need arises, rather than sacrificing too much consumption early in retirement to plan for expenses that may never occur.\nRead More About Retirement Planning\n",

            "content_html": "<p>You are the CEO of your money \u2013 at the end of the day, managing your money is your job, and you\u2019ve got important decisions to make. Your ability to manage finances is critical to determining what your future will look like. One big part of this is figuring out where you should save and how you should spend in retirement.</p>\n<h2>Where Should I Save?</h2>\n<p>Unless you inherit or marry money (or win the lottery), there are only two ways to afford retirement: Get a job that offers a good pension, or save and invest.</p>\n<p>Assuming the latter applies to most of us, the next question is: where should you be saving? Generally, the primary choices of accounts and investment vehicles available include tax-advantaged retirement accounts, taxable brokerage accounts, bank accounts, physical property, or paying down debt. With so many potential variables, it\u2019s impossible to offer hard rules that will apply to everyone. However, we generally recommend the following:</p>\n<h2>7 Tips to Save Money</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Pay off any high-interest debt first.</li>\n<li>If your employer offers any kind of matching contribution to your 401k, then you should save at least up the amount matched.</li>\n<li>If no employer match is available, you should try to maximize savings in tax-advantaged retirement accounts before saving in taxable accounts. These include accounts like traditional and Roth 401ks and IRAs</li>\n<li>If you have kids, it usually makes sense to open one or more 529 accounts which cover education-related costs. But only do this if your other tax-advantaged retirement account contributions are maxed out. Remember, you can borrow for school, but you can\u2019t for retirement!</li>\n<li>A primary home can be a wonderful investment \u2013 the leverage of a mortgage and the tax benefits of the interest deduction usually make buying a home a good idea, as long as you can afford it and plan to live in it for at least six years.</li>\n<li>Speaking of buying a home, we don\u2019t usually recommend paying off your mortgage if you have a rate under 4.5% (unless you have a stock portfolio larger than the value of your home). If you don\u2019t have the stomach for stocks, however, then maintaining a mortgage and simultaneously holding a significant amount of lower yielding cash or bonds is simply throwing money away. In this case, go ahead and pay off the mortgage.</li>\n<li>While second homes and rental properties can be good investments, they\u2019re not for everyone; keep in mind that a second property that isn\u2019t rented out should be considered consumption, not an investment.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How Should I Spend?</h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019re retired, adhering to the right spending level is one of your most important financial responsibilities. Spend too much and you risk running out of money. Spend too little and you will miss out on valuable life experiences. There is a complicated whirl of variables and \u201cwhat if?\u201d scenarios that will have a direct bearing on your spending level.</p>\n<h2>Questions for Retirement</h2>\n<p>Here are some good questions to ask yourself when it comes to spending in retirement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When do I want to retire?</li>\n<li>How long will I live?</li>\n<li>What about my spouse?</li>\n<li>How much will healthcare cost?</li>\n<li>Will I move?</li>\n<li>How much do I want to leave behind?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Your Withdrawal Rate</h2>\n<p>From an asset management perspective, the spending question is usually framed in terms of one\u2019s \u201cwithdrawal rate,\u201d which is the amount spent from your investment portfolio each year as a percentage of the total portfolio value. Typically, it is assumed the original withdrawal dollar amount remains constant, except for an annual inflation adjustment.</p>\n<p>Your goal should be to find a withdrawal rate that balances your lifestyle needs with a minimal (or at least acceptable) risk of running out of money. Like many things in life, luck and timing play a big role in your financial success in retirement. These factors may be beyond your control, but regardless of how they play out, it\u2019s up to you to exercise control where you can. Establishing and maintaining a disciplined withdrawal strategy for your retirement will substantially increase your odds of success.</p>\n<p>An industry rule of thumb \u2013 the 4% Rule \u2013 suggests that balanced portfolios will not run out of money if the withdrawal rate is limited to 4% annually. Withdrawals are not adjusted for market returns. You can perform a rough estimate of your retirement planning position by using this rule.</p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Forget Health Care</h2>\n<p>Another area of spending many people don\u2019t think about is health care. The average couple retiring at 65 will spend about $275,000 on health care over the course of their retirement. These expenses can come in the form of long-term care. Medicaid laws ensure that you will not be thrown out on the street if your assets are depleted because of long-term care costs. In fact, it may be worth planning to make use of this government insurance policy if/when the need arises, rather than sacrificing too much consumption early in retirement to plan for expenses that may never occur.</p>\n<p><a class=\"marketing-link-large\" href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/category/retirement-planning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read More About Retirement Planning</a></p>\n",

But one important thing to remember is this: bull markets don\u2019t die simply from old age.\nValuations are above historical averages, but this doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re particularly concerning. Why? Because of tax cuts and interest rates. With tax cuts boosting earnings for most companies (though not yet fully reflected in analyst projections), valuations are not especially frightening.\nAlso of concern to some is a flattish yield curve, which historically have been precursors for recessions and declining stock prices (i.e. flat or inverted yield curves). Longer-term rates remain stubbornly low. But today, low corporate bond yields are providing cheap financing for most publicly traded companies.\nWe don\u2019t see signs of economic slowdown or anything that may impact the availability of credit/liquidity, which typically are the enders of bull markets.\nShrinking Supply\nStock prices are a function of supply and demand, and supply is shrinking, with the number of public companies shrinking by more than half in the last 20 years, and total shares outstanding on the S&P 500 falling about 22 billion since 2011, according to Yardeni Research.\nSo as the money pouring into stock funds are sourced from things like 401k and pension fund contributions, or bonuses getting invested, it is spread among fewer stocks and fewer shares, making those shares more valuable. While it\u2019s impossible to know this trend\u2019s full impact or how long stocks will benefit, a reduced supply could be a powerful bullish force.\nGlobal Outlook\nU.S. stocks have dominated their international counterparts in this bull market, which resulted in higher valuations. The forward PE of the MSCI US Index is 19, while the forward-looking PE of the rest of the world is 16, according to MSCI, and on an even playing field, that makes international stocks more attractive looking ahead. As always, we strongly believe a strategic allocation to each, and a disciplined approach to rebalancing, gives the best chance for long-term success.\nSector Bets Are Getting Bigger (Again)\nMost bull markets are headlined by a specific sector. This year, Technology is again rallying and gobbling up share of the market in the process, now representing 24% of the S&P 500. If you are an index investor, you should probably take notice, since this may be a bigger bet than what you realize or want especially if you also own individual stock positions in favorites like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon or Netflix. Chinese technology stocks have experienced a rapid rise, so a similar issue exists in many international stock index funds.\nWe are not bearish on Technology stocks, or growth stocks in general. The recent rally and valuations are nowhere as extreme as we saw in the late 1990s and it is entirely likely to continue for another year or more.

            "content": "We are amidst one of the longest bull markets in history, which leaves many affluent investors to ask: What comes next?\nIt looks like even for those who seem to have everything, the future is still uncertain.\nWhat will happen with the market? How can investors protect themselves against the uncertainty ahead? And how will the government, politics, and tax policies impact them?\nThese are just a few of the questions we asked in a survey we commissioned with ORC International of over 1,000 U.S. affluent adults (those who have total household investable assets of $500,000 or more*) to see how they are thinking about the future.\nSome key findings include:\nFaith in the Market; Fear in the Portfolio\nNearly half (48%) of survey respondents believe the market will perform better in 2018 than it did in 2017; only 9% think the market will decline in 2018. Millennials seem to be especially optimistic, with 67% predicting 2018 will be an even better year than 2017, versus 53% of Gen X, 32% of Baby Boomers and 32% of Silent.\nWith so many believing the market will perform well, a surprising number of affluent investors (16%) have most of their net worth invested in cash. Why can this be an issue? Holding cash in a simple savings account could effectively manufacture your own market downturn if inflation rises and interest rates remain low. There are many reasons to keep cash on hand, but data suggests that you can miss out on good investment opportunities without proper diversification. In addition, recency bias makes it easy to forget that markets are cyclical and we will eventually see a downturn. A lack of diversification can also be harmful to your portfolio in this sense as well.\nThe good news is that mistakes can be fixed. Honesty and acknowledging a pain point can be the first step in fixing a financial problem. Working with a financial advisor may also be a good step to take in the right direction.\nThe Trump Effect in 2018\nTax reform dominated the headlines in the recent months, and just like other Americans, the affluent are divided over almost everything tax-related. What\u2019s an appropriate tax rate? Are Trump\u2019s policies a net positive for investment portfolios?\nAlthough your tax rate depends on your state and your income, 15% of respondents indicated they think people making more than $1 million should pay higher taxes. There were also geographic differences, with GOP strongholds in the Midwest less likely to favor higher taxes for wealthy individuals compared to the Southern region and the relatively Democratic-friendly regions in the Northeast and West, who favored higher rates for these individuals.\nAnother matter inside the political realm (but outside taxes) causing dissonance is whether a Democrat or Republican-controlled Congress in 2018 is best for the finances of the mass affluent. Women (57%) were more likely than men (44%) to favor Democrats, and Millennials (56%) and Gen X\u2019ers (58%), Baby Boomers (43%) and the Silent Generation (38%) say a Democrat-controlled Congress would have a positive impact.\nCharitable Giving: \u2018Tis the Season for Generosity, Especially Among Millennials\nAs we are amidst the holiday season, which means that many people are thinking about charitable giving. They\u2019re not alone. Nearly everyone we surveyed contributes to a charitable cause. Millennials are especially generous \u2013 47% report they\u2019ve given more than $20,000 in 2017! And this generosity may stand to increase as we continue toward the future greatest wealth transfer in history. Regardless of generation, the mass affluent give to a wide variety of charity causes, such as health, animals, poverty and education-related causes leading the funding charge in 2017.\nOur Take\nWhile affluent Americans may look forward to a healthy financial future, they still also have a healthy dose of skepticism and doubt. With the market\u2019s performance trending upwards, we should remind ourselves that what goes up must come down, and it\u2019s critical to be prepared for that eventuality. Speaking to a financial advisor can help you navigate political and economic uncertainties, while still planning for the future.\nRead our free affluent American survey to learn more about how the affluent think about the future.\nDownload Report\n",
